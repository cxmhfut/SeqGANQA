If they agree to follow me, yes.
I know.
I have n't given you much of a life.
Thank god ...
I do n't want you to wait for me.
That's something you ca n't decide.
You do n't usually ask.
I am busy inside.
Yes ... i remember ...
Appointment to what?
Viceroy of the west indies.
There'll be a time.
This time with me!
Not bad.
There must be a passage to that other ocean.

All of them created by people like me.
What is it? a tribe? an island?
Island. far.

We're lost!
The land is there. i know it!
You're right. let the men decide.

Not when i'm with you, ted.
Now!
Compute!
Is he making any progress, doctor?
I'm so excited, simon.
I guess this is a first for you.
No, i've been excited before.
So mentally ill?
I think so.
That's my girl.
Simon, what are you saying?!
You can do it from up here, captain.

He had fish.
Extremely serious. it starts with a slight fever.
Ted!
Elaine, i've got to talk to you.
I love you.
Headquarters!? what is it?
And a little ice.
And a little ice!
Sluggish. like a wet sponge.

Yes?
Uh-huh.
Hello.

Good-bye, darling.
Did you decide on a runway yet?

Huh?

He did n't recognize me.

And that fits?
Why'd i do what?
At the end of the bar.
Back off, george.
But i --.
I'll handle it.
Screw me? that ca n't be right.
Your mother mates out of season.
Stay back! i'm okay.
This is mole. it's good.

Plenty! twenty-six minutes!
We're not leaving!
Well, thanks, i --

Do n't make me pull rank, ripley.
Dead on all channels.
Thirty-eight ... simulated.
The structure seems intact. they have power.
Gorman! give it a rest would you.
I do n't know.
Proceed inside.
So ... then the fusion containment shuts down.
So? so?
Shut up. just shut up!
They're but off! do something!
Yes, hicks?
Hudson, sir. he's hicks.
What's the question?
How do i get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
He's coming in. i feel safer already.

Let's get these things lit.
Six meters. five. what the fu --
Fuckin' a!
On my way.

You're just reading me.
Uh, what's next?
Seal the door.
Ca n't be. that's inside the room!
It's readin' right. look!
Terrible.
What about me?
Why not?
Cross my heart.
And hope to die?
I'm sorry, newt.
Why do they tell little kids that?
Did you ever have a baby?
Yes. a little girl.
Where is she?
Gone.
You mean dead.
Wah ...? where are ...?
Look!
Right here, baby. right here.
That's right.
Can we dream?
Yes, honey. i think we both can.
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
Sweet jesus.
What do you mean?
Good morning.
Oh? news travels fast in vienna.
Is there a part for me?
No.
How do you know?
In a harem.
What's that?
A brothel.
Oh!
A turkish brothel.
Perhaps.
You might be disappointed.
Why?
What?
The marriage!
Well, what does it matter to you?
You were sublime.
What did you think of the music?
Extremely clever.
Meaning you did n't like it.
What?
Do n't bother.
I'll be right back.
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
No, she's fine.
I'm so relieved.
What??
I want to go!
Where?
I want to go back to vienna.
Now?
Yes!
Why?
I feel wrong. i feel wrong being here.
What are you talking about?
Why? people fart backwards.
Do you think that's funny?
Yes, you are. you're very sick.
No, i'm not playing this game.
No, this is serious. say it backwards.
No!
What?
Eat
Yes.
Eat my- ah!
Yes!
Well, do n't do that again!
Tell them to go!
Sssh. what is it? tell me.
No!
Yes!
I love you! i love you!
What does she want?
I do n't know.
Well, ask her!
Yes, my love?
These gentlemen are from salzburg.
What?
Your father is dead.
Why not? half the house!
No one.
I heard voices.
Why not?
You'd think i was mad.
Why?
I ca n't write it!
Why not?
It's killing me.
Madame. how can i help you?
I understand.
No, sir. this is my own idea.
I see.
Yes.
Yes, sir. he does n't make copies.
Tonight?
Alone.
What for?
Some service deserves service in return. no?
What do you mean?
Is n't it obvious?
I was at hand.
And i'm asking you-
Not at all.
Where's our friend?
You're mad! she's mad, wolfi.
Oh, yes.
When, may i ask?
In three months! papa.
Be careful!
Adorable!
Behold!
Hey!
Behold!
Gertrude!
You ca n't be herr mozart!
Michael!
Yes. he is a little strange.
Ah, now! here she comes.
Who was your teacher?
It's just a trifle, of course.
May i try it?
Majesty.
Ah-ha!
Yes?
You already commissioned an opera from mozart.
And the result satisfies.
Well. there it is.
The director of our opera. count orsini-rosenberg.
Because i've already found the most wonderful libretto!
I think so, sire, yes.
And german?
Twenty-six.
Would you tell me why?
Well, majesty, it is only a comedy.
Well. there it is.
Your majesty, herr mozart-
Yes, what about him?
He's here.
Ah-ha. well. there it is. good.
Am i not welcome?
I do n't know. stanzi? stanzi!
It could n't be better.
That's not what i hear.
Pupils?
Yes.
Yes.
How many?
This one will.
Oh, let's not talk about it.
Why not?
It's a secret.
You do n't have secrets from me.
Why did n't you mention it in your letters?
This is just a game, papa.
Mine?
She does. she says i sleep all day.
Bene! bene!
Bene.
Do any pupils come to the house?
Not that i've seen.
Oh, i would n't know that, sir.
In there, sir.
I do n't know. he has pains.
Where?
Are you herr mozart?
That's right.
Sssh! stay here.
Sublime! utterly sublime!
That kind of music should be punishable by death.
I liked the horse.
Wolfi!
Put it down!
What is this?
What? the vaudeville, what'd you think?
Yes.
Can i see it?
No.
Why not?
Because there's nothing to see.
So let me see it. where is it?
Ah!
Did you like it, then?
How could i not?
Herr sommer.
Do you have a daughter?
I'm afraid not.
I ca n't say. really
With all my heart, mozart.
Thank you! oh, thank you.
Grazie, mio caro, wolfgang!
Grazie, a lei, signor antonio!
How could i not?
Did my work please you?
How could it not, excellency?
Yes?
I never knew that music like that was possible.
You flatter me.
What work?
A mass for the dead.
What dead? who is dead?
I do.
The doctor thinks i am. but-
What?
I'm too young to be so sick.
No! no, it's him!
Who?
The man. he's here.
What man?
He knows. he knows!
Do you believe in it?
What?
A fire which never dies. burning one forever?
Oh, yes.
Strange!
Come. let's begin.
We ended in f major?
Yes.
So now- a minor. suddenly.
What time?
Common time.
Sing it back.
First bassoon and tenor trombone- what?
With the tenors.
Also identical?
I think so.
Show me.
Yes!
You go fast!
Do you have it?
Yes.
Oh no. i'm not tired at all.
I am so ashamed.
What for?
Exactly.
Just let me tell you how it begins.
Taking out what you should never have put in.
What is what?
Is the emperor angry with me?
On the contrary.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Who is on this committee?
Baron!
In the sight of god that is a sin.
What do you want?
Do you understand that you have sinned? gravely.
Leave me alone.
I can not leave alone a soul in pain.
Here in vienna.
Then you must know this.
I regret it is not too familiar.
All vienna has heard that.
And do they believe it?
Is it true?
Do you believe it?
Should i?
Every day. sometimes for hours i would pray!
No? was mozart a good man?
No, you did n't!
I poisoned his life.
But not his body.
What difference does that make?
Exactly.
He's setting that play to music?
Yes.
You must be mad.
I've seen the manuscript.
Where?
Never mind.
Incredible.
The emperor has given him permission.
About the ballet.
Ballet? what ballet?
Well done, sire!
What? who the devil are you?
Well, promise then.
What do you mean- now?
Show her in. then go to bed.
Yes, i am looking after him.
Can we come in?
Well, he's sleeping now. better not.
But he's all right?
I'll call tomorrow.
The american? yes, duck.
How did he look?
Dr. hirsch?
Go about your duties.
Yes, doctor.
Yes, doctor?
What exactly did he call out?
Yes, i believe he did.
It's a full moon. where is he?
Yes.
What did he say?
David says jack comes to warn him.
Warn him?
Is david acting strangely?
No, not really.
Yes, i should think so.
Shall i send a car?
No, a cab will be faster.
I expect you shortly.
Tea would be nice.
I beg your pardon?
It was a wolf.
What?
A wolf.
Yes?
You have n't eaten your lunch.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
Please, really. i'm not hungry.
Sorry.
Call me alex.
Aw come on, alex!
Shall i be forced to feed you, david?
Will you give me a break?
I thought you were asleep.
I was. what are you reading?
I dream of death mostly.
That's not really a very proper question.
How old are you?
Twenty-eight.
I'm twenty-seven.
I know.
Now what do you want to talk about?
Was jack goodman your good friend?
My best friend. my very best friend.
Shall i read to you?
What? oh, yes, please.
I'm sorry i woke you up.
What?
You're being awfully forward, are n't you?
A werewolf?
I'll let you know the next full moon.
Your dead friend jack?
I would think so.
Yeah, i would think so, too.
Very nice.
Charming.
Bathroom.
Lovely.
The bedroom.
There is only one bed.
It's nice to see you.
Yes?
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
Of course.
Good.
But, david.
I was n't hallucinating.
That's good, alex. reassure me.
Anything.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
I've left those pills for you.
I should be committed.
Dr. hirsch will know what to do.
Pull over.
What?
We had an argument. he's being silly.
I swear, i do n't know this girl.
David, let's go now.
No.
No what?
No.
No.
Right.
No.
No what?
No!
I thought not.
I think he's a jew.
Why on earth do you say that?
I looked.
Yes, mrs. hobbs.
You did, did you?
No. you've had your chance.
I was having a nightmare.
Miss price, the other nurse that attended you.
What are you going to see?
Some, everyone does.
Yes, but does everyone kill bambi?
Bambi?
You're in a hospital in london.
So they said.
Yes.
Good.
David.
You're not having a good time are you?
You're talking about the woman i love.
Okay.
Shall we?
Nice to see you.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Look at that.
Maybe the owners are from texas.
You ask them.
Wrong.
You ask them.
What do you mean? i'm starving.
Come on, i'm freezing.
I have no idea.
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
I heard that.
What was it?
Yeah?
A coyote.
There are n't any coyotes in england.
The hound of the baskervilles.
Pecos bill.
Heathcliffe.
Heathcliffe did n't howl.
No, but he was on the moors.
Yeah.
I do n't know. come on.
Come on, where?
Anywhere! i think we should just keep moving.
It's circling us.
Plan?
Let's just keep walking.
Do you think it's a dog?
Walk away, jack.
No.
Not far enough. come on.
Yeah.
Where are we going?
I'll tell you when we get there.
Are you going to help me up?
Get the fuck out of here, jack.
Thanks a lot.
I ca n't stand it.
Life mocks me even in death.
David!
What?!
I'm not listening!
What?!
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
I wanted to see you.
Get out of here, jack!
What do you think?
Hi, david.
You do n't have to say anything.
You look awful.
Thank you.
Hello.
How shall i do it?
What here?
He's on the telephone.
Sorry, love.
I suppose guinness will suffice.
No.
No.
Oh.
I beg your pardon?
I'd like some tea, please.
I do n't rightly know, sir.
You here again? what do you want?
Yeah- sure!
Matt?
Yeah.
About twenty-four thousand.
It was more than that last week.
Yeah.
Here's twenty-five thousand.
Let me have ten bucks?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Not yet, mr. clark.
And tell him not to delay.
Yes, sir.
What about?
We'll discuss that in the board room.
That's very simple. i was home.
You understand?
Why, of course.
That do n't do us any good.
Well, what?
Well, are n't you going to invite me?
Do n't you know?
No.
I want to be near you!
My apartment.
What are you doing here?
Yes, sir.
Let me see your cash book, will you?
Now?
Yes, now.
John, how's your wife this morning?
Much better this morning, thank you.
Got a handkerchief?
No.
Ummm. stalling, eh? anything new?
Yes, sir.
In mr. sampson's office.
Now do n't you worry about it.
Good morning.
Mr. sampson...
All right. send him in.
Yes?
Get mrs. dickson on the phone.
Good morning, mr. dickson.
Got my letter?
Yes, thank you.
Hello, helen.
I have n't any.
You have n't got a uniform?
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
Looks good. how much did it cost?
There you are.
You're protecting somebody.
No, i'm not mr. dickson!
Why pick on him?
Here's the data on the clyde deal.
What are you talking about?
Yes, sir.
Mine too?
Absolutely.
It's his life insurance money, you know.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
He's at a board meeting.
Matt, come here!
Why?
Come here, honey!
With what?
The ten dollars.
Yes.
Oh, you think i'm lying?
Yes.
Well, he was making love to her.
I tell you, i saw them!
Oh, charlie again.
They must have turned him down.
Yes, why?
He was in the bank yesterday.
He was here?
He came to see mr. cluett.
Are you sure?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
What time was it, mrs. halligan?
Huh?
What time did matt brown get in?
It could n't have been earlier?
No. it was n't earlier because ...
I do n't know.
Yes.
What time did you get in?
Well, about- uh- eleven o'clock.
I'm okay, matt.
You've got enough?
I guess so.
Where's charlie?
I said like a comanche, not this comanche.
Jim younger, i told you --
Sometimes a wound will kill.
Now you tell us.
Never a good thing.
Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
You stay out of this, bob.
What have you done?
I ai n't done --
What have you done?!
Swear.
I swear --
Swear on jimmy's grave.
It's tougher than it looks.
Well, somebody better go tell the damn yankees!
Nope.
Then i love it.
He just lost his temper a little.
Tomorrow.
Two.
Not yet. but i'm hoping.
Exactly.
He's planning a job.
What?
I think i recognize you.
How?
What's going on?
I could use the walk.
Planting corn. harvesting corn. year after year.
You're not scared, are you?
What is wrong with you?
She got two of them.
She was european!
Let's ride.
Sorry.
Do n't let it happen again.
I got three.
Sure, cousin.
What will be?
I got us through the war all right.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
That's it.
And i'm the better outlaw.
Then let me run the show, general lee.
A trap.
Pass me some whisky.
I'm out.
Missed you too, cousin.
I'm thinking ...
Both would be nice.
Which one, right or left?
The brown one.
Ah.
Get buckets!

They gon na rush us?
They're just insurance in case we run.
Of course! uh, sir?

Where is jesse james?
This here is the younger gang!
Yeah, injun. what do you want?
Great chief of st. louis send me.
The district marshall
You're right, sir.
Then why ca n't i go in there?
On account of we're robbing it.
Oh. why did n't you just say so?
It's a secret.
Fine. i'll just wait here.
I'd appreciate that.
What is it?
I had you covered. from back there.
Shit.
Died a hero.
I fooled them into thinking i was alone.
Pff. they hardly even noticed you.
Such as?
I figure.
I reckoned.
Hell of a war.
You're doing just fine.
Maybe, maybe ...
You can shut up now.
You are a charmer.
I swear i'll shoot you in your sleep.
Next time try `` fat and haggard.''
What worries me is that jesus is talking back.
Heard of him.
Ma.
Fine. how'd it go out here?
We're gon na have to talk ...
The posters?
Jesse, we're outlaws.
And we're good at it.
If i could go back to farming --
Maybe it started out that way. but now ...
Oh yeah.
No, i --
Yeah, jimmy?
That he was.
They're making him a hero now.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
But he killed a lot of men, too.
Ca n't argue that.
So what was he?
Yeah jimmy?
How much of that story is true?
Everything but the boring parts.
A fair number, ma.
Say your prayers?
We're just fine, thank you, sir.
Boys?
Shush.
You were little jesse james when you left.
But you got big!
Mmmm.
What?
And what's this right girl like?
Little ones.
Let the law --
`` hmm'' what?
Stop it. this is just sad.
Swimming. swimming is good.
What?
Yes ma'am.
Do n't swear.
Yes ma'am.
I'll explain on the way.
But i like the presidential suite.
Pity.
Last february?
Mmm.

Ahh, you'll miss me.
Who needs to repair a leaky church roof.

Have we met?
You mean you do n't recall??
Promised? who promised?
There, look!
Mr. john steed, please.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Impossible?
As you see.
Then you ca n't come in.
I have an appointment.
Eh? in here!
We have met ...
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
People, too.
Then who wins?
Looks like rain, steed ...
Let me guess --'father'?
We want to help ...!
A cover ... for us. i'm sorry ...
Quite frankly ... it could have been you.
Next assignment?
Thanks, valentine ...
An unholy trinity ...
You killed my husband.
But -- why?
I'm already married ...
Valentine, listen to me ...
Choices?
I'll never marry you.
I had a spot of bother at the door.
Mother?
Really? i fail to see the connection.
I had a feeling you would. touche!
Yes indeed. i need protection.
Thank you, trubshaw ...
Do we always follow mother's instructions?
For a man in my position --
I meant me.
Any other vices?
You should be dead. how do you feel?
Strange.
Did you say formal? i must dress.
Any ideas?
Common knowledge, mrs. peel ...
Do n't bother. here's a bus ...
Is there anything that is n't?
That's what we were working on.
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
... and by you, mrs. peel ...
Barely.
Mrs. peel ...?
Orders.
To kill me?
Nothing personal.
No trouble.
Because you always obey orders ...
Always. except ...
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
Is that all?
Not for a moment.
You're playing games.
Are n't we all, mrs. peel?
I thought you played by the rules.
I thought you did n't.
I'm playing to win.
Winning is n't everything.
You do n't trust me?
As far as you trust me.
You lied.
Why's he called'invisible'?
You'll find out.
Hurry? what for? i'm just now --
You did n't tell her?
It's called black leather.
Intoxicating. here, have one of these.
Shall we?
Snuff. i must insist you try some.
Where are you going?
What kept you?
The plot. hello, we must be going ...
' ... in a beautiful pea green boat ...'
A fine night, mrs. peel ...
Still a bit chilly ...
As a matter of fact i have ...
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Not quite.
Pity your mother came, too ...
Half-brother to be precise.
Makes two of us.
Getting to what?
Let me guess: wonderland weather.
Very good, mrs. peel ...
I shall need a small plane.
You're not venturing alone, surely.
Global warming?
We want mrs. peel.
Dead, i'm afraid.
How did you guess?
You reek of mrs. peel's black leather ...
Brenda and i thought we'd drop in.
Possibly. split personality ...
Insane ...?
She may try to kill you.
You.
Mother and father know best.
In your operation.
I think so, thank you so much ...
Both, actually.
This way ...
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
No, please! i beg you ...
Walk over to the window ...
Let it be rain, please let it be --
Stay by the window. by the window.
Perish the thought.
I was at harrow ...
But did they teach you this?
You wish.
That's not playing by the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
If you say so.
I do.
Did i? my mistake.
You are, and it's behind you.
Debbie's marrying rick.
... really?
Really -- you went with him for two years.
Check out the other guy's buns.
I feel like i'm spying on rick.
Yeah. what is it?
You're kidding.
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
When do the girls get to the party?
I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
Bond ... james bond.
Cole ...
You dump her and i'll give you cash.
What's debbie's blue book value right now?
Five thousand dollars.

You do n't believe me? okay, fine.
You're on.
Yeah.
I know what i'm doing ... go!
You know your father enjoys his company.
Ilene, we do n't really know that.
Quiet, mother.
I hope those guys are all right.
Well ... hope she'll be very happy.
I think i screwed that one once.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
Okay. nice to meet you both.

I'm going to see what the hell happened.
Yes.
I did n't know you were into that.
Rick, i really think i'm in love.
You're a pimp?
I'm telling you i am, joe.
I want women.
Big problem now. soon they go to customers.
That's it.
Good.
Right.

I just want to be alone.
Yeah, i guess so.
Really?
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
It's bullwinkle.
All right, who serves?
I'd love that.
Rick!
Oh, no!
No sob story is going to change my mind.
No. let's at least finish the set.
The phone made me do it!
You've been having strange sex ...!
No, brett, i ...
It's all right ... so have i.
Mrs.?
I'm separated.
Knowing larry, he probably missed the flight.
Nothing ... let's get crazy!
Then it's on to the real thing.
C'mon. i insist.

The best table in the house.

I will let down the steps for your honor.
You are going to drive to the frontier.
All europe shall hear of this!
As you please.

Perfectly certain, because i shall make him tremble.
Take to your legs, low irish dog.
Have you had one?
Never.
But, for a time ... a passing fancy?
Not even that.
Have you not a man whom you value?
It is my only object.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
Old fool!
Then you must get it.
With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
As much as possible?
Yes, for i wish to entertain splendidly.
All the same, you must name an amount.

Good night, my little darling.

Shut up, mueller.
Shut up. west's dead.
I asked for a policeman.
What do you like then?
They're dead, are n't they?
I'm not telling you what happened.
Tell me about them.
That'd be my reaction too --
He's lying.
Yeah, we know, pike did.
You saw west's body.
Of course --
Yeah --
But not pike's.
You wan na bet?

Hunting -- we had to hunt him --

Maybe he ...
Home, i'm done.
What about the confession?
Does osborne agree?

Or what? you've gone round the bend --
You knew sergeant west?
Senator jonathan kendall, of ohio.
Yes.
Move him.
Why?
Is dunbar cute?
That is the most unprofessional --
Something like that.

You made me look like an idiot --
We're in the middle of a murder case --
Best time for banal chit-chat.
Something like that. you?
I lost a bet.
You're off to a late start.
So noted.
Being back here. gives me the willies.
Not the happiest of memories?
I do n't know.
Watch me.

In rome, i'll bow.
Nick, we ca n't just --
I said let's go, charlie.
First decent idea you've had.
You said that in the last two places.

Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
What'd she say?
Cool?
You all right? you okay?

Are we getting married?
Four goddamn days. this is going nowhere ...
Ichiro --
Good. very good ...
You were too far behind.
I'll check it out.
Shut-up.
I want to go talk to him.
What ...? why?
Because he knows how to get to our man.
He'll never speak to a gaiijin.
I'll be a nice gaiijin.
Big enough.
It's illegal, nick.
Let's go. him first.
Nick, you ca n't do this.

We ca n't lose.
How can you be so sure?
He gets as much as he wants.
There was a change in plans.
Gaiijin?
You have a helluva way of answering.
I do n't think so.
He's on duty.
I paid for that.
Where's ich?
Unavailable.
You could fake it.
He drinks.
He's got a reason.
You met her.
I do n't remember you saying no.
Who am i supposed to be?
The cheese ...
No one's keeping him here.
What if i chant?
Would n't help. watch out for ich.
I'm taking you back.

Time, i've got plenty of.
I'm amused.

This by this ...
Dope?

He was my partner.
It is not allowed.
We're police officers.

If anything happens to her while i'm here --
Goodbye, officer.
He'll be dealt with.
I'll pay you.
You want him dead too.
Well stocked.
If he wo n't cooperate?
Where?
Anywhere.
Not to be trapped.
You underestimate the trap, mary.
Then go get him.
That would n't be very sporting.
Oh?
Can the maker repair what he makes?
Would you like to be modified?
Had in mind something a little more radical.
What's the problem?

She's not going to notice, anthony.
I do n't want to use it.
Well, then cut it in half.
I keep it for emergencies.
Dignan, those are n't running shoes.
Yes, they are.
Look at the treads on those.

They obviously were n't designed for racing.
You were spoiled rotten.
I'll say it.

Bob?
Do n't worry about it, bob.
Where was it parked?
Right here.
Maybe he just went to the store.
We said 48 hours.
That's a long time to be in jail.

He told you and you let him do it.

It's going back down.
Applejack! what's happening?
Nobody move!
Get against the wall!
Careful. check his pulse.

Jesus christ, anthony. did you lose him?
Let's go. come on.
Come on, kumar.
Applejack's stuck in the elevator?
I'll see you there.

You got to be kidding me.
I'm not kidding.
What'd he get?
Pretty much everything.

We're not sure.
Nothing.
It belongs to bob's uncle.
How big is it?
Oh, i'd say about --
Behind bob's house.
He stole a tractor.

How?
Shhh. wait for my instructions.
Dignan, i --
Nice to meet you.
That's a sharp jacket.
Thanks.
What do you mean?
Take a deep breath.
It feels good.
Yes, he did.
How'd he do?
No, that door over there.
I do n't want to die.
Are you afraid?
Death.
Anthony, i'm petrified.
It's an esoteric journey.
Can i ask you something, mr. henry?
Absolutely.
Why'd you want to help us?
Who?
It's private property. plus i have hector.
I do n't know. sure, i guess.
You could make your own cinnamon toast.
Let them fight.
Yeah. he said that.
See you, bob.
Phil probably provoked him. where's he going?
Move.
Is that ok?
I'm not playing any more golf.
Why not?
Yes. you just got to stick with it.
Why do you say that?
Well, because you guys do n't look alike.
No. i was n't adopted.
Jesus christ! no.
It was stupid.
Hopscotch. the code name is hopscotch.

You're the faggot.
The one and only little richard.
Not even for emergencies?

They are.
So who's going to know?
My brother.
Let's cut the bullshit.
Can you use a coaster.
Yes. i did.
Ok, bob.
It's true, dignan.
You're paranoid, bob.
Yeah, but do n't tell anybody.
I ca n't believe you said that.
What did i say?
I told you he's crazy.
I warned you, dignan.
Maybe she turned.
Let's just go.
That's your domain.
Ok.
God dammit.
Shhh. slow down, bob. drive natural.
This is natural.
That's good. keep it at forty.
Did we get it?
Do n't count it.
No. i was calm.
I do n't want to talk about it.
Bob, i've got nightmares.
I told you they were there.
So it's my fault?
I do n't know.
What the fuck possessed you?
You're the one who kept saying ram him.
See you in a little while.
My brother's in jail.
What are you talking about?
That could be anybody's.
I do n't know.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Bob, that makes no sense.
Come on, dignan.
Do n't `` come on, dignan'' me.
I'm going back.
Not in that car you're not.
Watch me.
Good luck, since i got the keys.
I ca n't do that, bob.

What is it?
Just get in the car, bob.
What's his name?
Let's go.
Anthony. bad news.

That's ok.
Look. we want you on the job.
I know it, man. hang on.

No good options left?
Thanks.
The sooner the better.
Is it a slam dunk? no, but ...
Jesus ...
Including landy ... she had access to the archives.

Please do n't ...
She knows how to take care of herself.
Hi ...
Why?
Well, this *is* an orphanage.
I never said they were boring.
I love you, too. see you tomorrow.
He *loved* it! did n't you?
They wanted a girl.
Nobody ever wants me!
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
Nobody special enough, curly.
You mean somebody asked?
Only the right people can have you, curly.
How old are you, dear? thirteen?
Cirrhosis -- it's a disease of the liver.
But did you know him?
Barely. it hardly mattered that i knew him.
Did you know your mother better?
She looks after other people's children.
Did you grow up around here?
No. she was an immigrant.
What's an immigrant?
Someone not from maine.
Is that soon?
I do n't remember.
Liberator ...
Have you enlisted?
We're heading back to cape kenneth.
Migrants?
What about the trees?
You still doin' it too fast!
Okay. then you can be of use.
Yes, for both.
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
Obviously.
I do n't know it.
Nobody's named this one yet.
It's my turn!
I do n't think so.
You do it then.
I'm not crazy about the `` little ...''
Pretty, ai n't it? you a plumber?
It's just my heart.
What you got a picture of your heart for?
I ca n't read. nobody taught me.
Not yet. what do you know about it?
That's it.
Now, now. he's a good boy.
Shit. we do n't know what he is.
When will he be home, major?
Four weeks or so, right around halloween.
They told muddy his feet was too flat!
Sorry, homer ...
It look nicer then home!
She took off in the night!
She took off on the bicycle, man.
He ai n't never been outta maine!
On me. for the seat. cheers.
Everything looks in order.
This has to happen fast.
I know. it wo n't go unnoticed.
There'll be red flags.
The standard ten.
Ten percent. of how much?
Two million.
Know who i am, jake?
The anti-christ?
Your life flashing before your eyes?
Just the last three weeks.
That's not a bad place to start.
Factors that were n't clear to me until now.
Luck's a funny thing. especially the bad.
Like what?
After you cut her loose.
She walked.
Today? started off great ...
Fine. but only if we recover the cash.
Come on ...
We're going to give him the money back?
Let's go, jake?
So what? we just stay clear of him.
I told you, use less powder.
But you wo n't get that splatter effect.
And what about big al?
Tonight. just me.
Yes, her. where's my wallet?
Two million.
We pay better.
She's up for it.
Eight a.m. flight.
Calls?
That's it.
Minus one.
Why not?
Let me rephrase -- i wo n't do that.
Let me repeat -- why not?
Because you killed one of my crew.
I think two million.
Stake you?
I said take off your fucking shirt.
No thanks. i'm good.
Come here!
I think i just broke my hand.
Harder. remember, i killed your buddy.
Yeah well, sobo's kid needs braces.
Gunther? i think i'd remember a gunther.
Ring it for him, sobo.
Good boy.
Help me.
We're not cops.
You interested in a little work?
You get an equal cut.
What do i have to do?
Just play a part. a little acting.
I'll worry about customs.
Do n't worry about it.
What?
And some new clothes.
Why?
I do n't trust anyone.
Then show me how.
Uh-huh.
I got ta go get a haircut.
Uh-huh.
For what? a couple hundred bucks?
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
Intuition.
What?
I said, how do -- deal with that?
What about what?
What about the money?
What do you want? an apology?
No, i want my cut!
Then shut up.
My place.
You sure we're clear?
You better get over to al's. now.
Wait a second ... who's the mope?
Breasts.
What?
You sure?
Where the hell is she?
Jake? customs?
This is embarrassing.
I'll find the time.
Keep it up.
What?
Stand up.
Sorry. what?
In over your head?
Pretty much.
Huh? oh. she's alright.
Then who's the banker?
The king.
So what do you want?
I try.
We're here.
Peace of mind.
That's it?
Not everyone's on the take, walter.
To who?
That's what i'm talking about.
I'm down!
High five.
Hi, jack. welcome to the cesspit.
Is it that bad?
How do i look?
No. thanks.
My car's in the garage.
Maybe another time.
I'll take you up on that.
Goodnight.
It's the tension.
All men are cheats.
I got scared.
I can imagine.
Sorry.
What are you talking about?
What's the blue book price?
How about five hundred.
What?!
How about we split the diff ... seven-fifty.
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
Seven-fifty.
All right. as what?
Looking forward!
Who was he?
She.
Get what? are you accusing me of cheating?
Not particularly.
And your lady?
Not entirely.
You mean i wo n't resist them.
I wo n't be that long.
It's not just inner beauty, is it?
Turn around.
I. sold the car.
I've got something to tell you.
I want to hear it.
I've got a job.
What job?
It came my way. 450 a week.
You've got such beautiful hands.
I do n't know.
Fine.
Tension. it'll go.
Poor baby. this'll relax you.
It's only hair. i have n't changed.
Probably.
Have n't you got a conscience of your own?
Why not?
Without hope there's no point to anything.
Leave it.
No. answer it!
I hope it brings you luck.
It will.
You will?
You were talking in your sleep.
Not talking. writing.
Never. why do you ask?
Really?
There was a message, was n't there?
Nothing about you.
Then what?
Leave me alone, marion.
You're already alone.
I hate public transport.
What?
I want to buy a car.
How can anyone be that naive?
Found a job?
No.
Do n't let yourself down.
I wo n't. goodbye, dad.
Well, thank you anyway.
There's a casino in this hotel.
In the casino.
And the lies. gamblers are born liars.
And superstitious too. it's like witchcraft.
Do you believe in astrology?
Toss you for it.
I do n't gamble.
Just an accident. nothing.
Turn left ahead.
I'll watch.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
You do n't like cheats, do you.
You choose.
Then you're not a pro.
What kind of trouble?
I owe a lot of money.
Who's they?
The point is, they want a man inside.
And i thought you were a bright woman.
It wo n't.
But if it does.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
What ten thousand pounds?
What about my neck?
Wait a minute ...
No, forget it. the bet's off.
Let it go.
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
I told you, all bets are off.
What for?
I have to take the car.
Yes.
Thank you.
Yes.
Bruise? oh, yes. it's better.
I've still got mine.
I took the bandage off yesterday.
No thank you.
Jack! it's jani.
Who ...
Ross.
Who did it? tell me!
You did?
Have i?
I'm lucy.
And what do you do, lucy?
I might.
Turn left at the lights.
Over the river.
Have you got transport?
She's my baby.
How long have you worked at the casino?
Just girls. what are you drinking?
Vodka. straight. on the rocks.
Good call. help yourself.
That bitch? no.
No thanks.
Do n't worry, i wo n't report you!
I do n't gamble.
Do n't worry.
Rough life, jack.
I'll tell you later.
I'm afraid that's not so, sir.
It was you, you shit.
Why four? and not three or five?
Any exceptions?
Give me 365.
We do.
Where's the magnet?
They've been tested.
I do n't think so.
Wipe your hands.
You wo n't. not without permission.
Five.
I make it six.
Five.
I said good call.
Ever?
I do n't gamble, mr reynolds.
Yes.
She's not in the gaming business is she?
No.
Fine.
That hair will have to go.
Fine.
All right, mr reynolds.
He's a good customer.
I can see.
A pleasure. pity about bella.
Bruised.
Right, that checks out here.
Yeah.
I think he's talking to it.
Key? key? what is the key?
Where's the fail-safe key?
The key!
Christ, twenty seconds, christ!
Where is the key?
Oh, god ...
It did n't go off.
Boiler, we're alive. my heart.
Doolittle, are you there?
Well, it is kind of a long shot ...
I read the same here.
Arm yourself, bomb.
Do you remember the detonation time?
Detonation in twenty minutes.
Huh?
Therefore, i shall ignore you.
Hello, bomb.
The only thing which exists is myself.
Bomb?
And i saw that i was alone.
Of course.
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
I am always receptive to suggestions.
But how do you know you exist?
It is intuitively obvious.
Right!
This is fun.
Because i must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
And you can only do it once, right?
That is correct.
So if you detonate in ...
... nine seconds ...
You have no proof that it was correct data.
I'll check it.
Yes, doolittle.
Your ghf reading is minus fifteen.
Doolittle ...
Yes.
Yeah. eight, it says here.
Any of'em any good?
Naah. all stable.
What?
Commander powell is dead.
Fred.
Wha?
I hereby name this star fred.
Veil nebula.
Who cares?
Ah, negative drop.
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
-- automatic channels open --
-- remark.
5-4-3-2-1-drop, drop, drop!
Yeah, doolittle. what's up?
Must get lonely being up here so much.
I'm getting something here, on this readout ...
Yes, talby, what is it?
Sh, talby, do n't bother me now.
Calm down, talby. i'm coming.
Doolittle ... i think it's the phoenix asteroids!
Phoenix?
What's that, sir?
What was that, doolittle?
Negative effect.
It did n't work?
That's correct, sir.
Doolittle, hello?
Oh, yes, doolittle, i'm thinking.
We're running out of time, sir.
Talk to the bomb.
Phenomenology ...
Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
Bruno's girlfriend.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
But see tonight wives and girlfriends are n't invited.
No?
Guess again.
What?
That's not why we're here.
But the boss knows i always been loyal.
Who's camille?
None of your business.
You did n't tell me you lived with her.
You know each other?
Leave. now.
Can i say something in my defense?
No.
Where?
You mean until you showed up?
You're not still pissed?
She was there ...
Police drone.
What? where're we going?
No time.
No way.
Do n't look down.
A grand.
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
Later.
I'll make it worth your while.
It's a rule.
Am i?
Every week.
Shhh! do n't do that!
They took my daughter.
I know.
Look, i'd really like to ...
No ...
Mommy, where are you?
Soon, baby.
Mommy, i'm scared.
Girl's got ta make a living.
Thank god.
First time i ever heard that.
I was expecting someone else.
Guess it was n't the pizza delivery guy.
You're lucky. i almost pulled the trigger.
Who is ...
Can we go somewhere and talk?
The one you're wearing?
Was n't that hard.
Girlfriend?
Something.
Yeah ...
I'm not a half bad cook.
You got a lotta nerve.
Bent.
That would be appropriate, yes.
We are not fine.
C'mere, i want to show you something.
The other ones?
The other one like you ...
You lost me.
Hardly ...
Your help.
I already do n't like the sound of this.
Somebody's got to.
Open it.
Deeds, not words. i need your help.
Ladies would be elsewhere.
You do n't want to.
But she does work here?
Ca n't help you.
None.
I'll wait.
A friend of your fiance's.
What do you want?
I think you should go now.
Let go of my hand.
I understand.
You did.
Just give it to me. i'll remember.
I'm on my way.
What?
No.
You know what i'm saying.
A long time.
Where?
It's a secret.
Yeah,'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
Unlikely.
And because he's my friend.
Friends do n't help other friends cheat.
They're prisoners to their genes.
So are dogs.
They do n't have a lot of moving parts.
Only one i can think of.
Not right now? okay, when?
You're gon na pay me fifty thousand dollars ...
I have sincere eyes.
She's gon na want to hear for herself.
You get it when i get her.
Feel like the dog's dinner.
Probably a touch of what's going around.
What if he's on the level?
You can tell'em yourself tomorrow.
Later.
I got ta meet natalie for dinner.
Right, the big one-oh.
But i'll take a rain check ...
We got ta talk.
What's up?
You left out condescending.
But there's another side --
Really?
Exactly.
Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic --
Lydia.
A toy?
-- a philandering pig.
Easy sketchy.
Say the words, `` i understand.''
I want you on call here.
For a change.
You're too kind. i'm amanda.
Gin.
More than anything in the world.
And he loves you back, does n't he?
Pick a song, hawk.
Got any kiss?
You kidding? this is detroit. drink?
Yeah, a man's drink ...
Thanks.
It's okay.
Yeah?
Believe it.
Right, slow ...
Oh, screw it!
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Yeah.

One more time in english.
Plenty, but it was all bad.
Yo, doofus!

Good morning ...
Are you afraid?
Good morning!
Horrible accident. my neighbour ... he got killed.
What happened?
Donnie. donnie darko.

Did you know him?
Donnie.
A metal craft of any kind.
Beg pardon?
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
Not until like ... eighth grade.
Donnie! give it back!
I did n't say shit.
What did you say?
Our saviour ...
You'll know soon enough.
Where did you come from?
Do you believe in time travel, donnie?
You have to do something for me first.
You have a request?
Take it off. i want to see you.
I am so sorry.
Why do they call you frank?
Hey ...
School's cancelled.
Sure.
We never would have had this conversation.
I'm sorry.
That was a compliment.
Will you go with me?
Where are we going?
I'm going home.
Yeah?
Well ...
You want to kiss me ...
No ... donnie, wait. i've never ...

Grandma death.
I know, dad.
Because the rabbits are us, donnie.
Would you like to talk about this friend?
His name is frank.
Frank.
I think he saved my life.
How so?
Do n't you watch the news?
I do n't own a television.
Follow him where?
So, tell me about your day, donald.
I met a girl.
What is her name?
Gretchen. we're going together now.
Do you think a lot about girls?
Yes.
How are things going at school?
I think about girls a lot.
I asked you about school.
I think about ... fucking a lot during school.
What else do you think about during school?
Four times ... so far.
Can anyone else see him?
It reminded me of my dog callie.
Is callie still around?
Have you told gretchen about the spears?
Yeah ... you know ... fucking.
Have you ever made love, donald?
Yes. i went to jail.
Hungry hungry hippos.
What else makes you feel regret?
That i did it again.
You've done it again?
I think now that he might ...
Why?
Because i'm so horny.
God exists because you're horny.
I have the power to build a time machine.
How is that possible?
Grandma death will teach me how. soon.
Then how is time travel possible?
Soon. time is almost up.
Frank is going to kill.
Who is he going to kill?
Where is he, donald?
Goodbye, donald.
Guess who wrote it?
Yeah.
What's her name?
Because you tell mom everything.
No i do n't. she worries about you.
Congratulations.
Excuse me? what's your name, son?
Gerald.
Well, gerald, i think you're afraid.
Come again?
Frank ... the giant bunny rabbit?
Frank?
You're not a bitch.
He was a year ahead of us?
Donnie? you're a dick.

Three quarters of an hour.
Oh nothing ... nothing of any great importance.
Nothing of any importance, eh?

You're losing your temper!
But, father, it is!
I said welcome.
Welcome?

Those things in your hands.
These? what are these? they're swords.
Yes.
But surely you know ...?
What was she like?
We never went to bed together.
I've never been to bed with anybody!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
And i thought you said it was something special ...
You're as bad as my father.
And the week before that?

Do you believe i love you?
I ... but i ...
Then let go!
The second note to wake the gods ...
No ... no ...
I do n't want to live without you.
It was my master keitel's idea.
We blew the horn resounding.
She blew the horn resounding.
I see the world.
Is it night or day, erik?
It is day, of course, freya.
Is it summer or winter, erik?
The gods are asleep, erik.
I will go and wake them up!
That i can not tell you.
Well ... is n't it great?
I'm sure it's lovely.
But you do n't want to hear it.
Really.
Yes?
You've got to let me go!
Why?
He wants to kill us!
Not when we explain about the great blessing.
You do n't know halfdan the black.
The important thing is not to panic.
Yes.
What about the raping?
Shut up.
You do n't love me.
I do n't suppose ... no ...
What?
About not raping you ...
You do n't like it, do you?
Well you started it.
Ah.
Louder.
Aaagh! rape!
Oh, thanks.
I dunno ... you looked so ... so vulnerable ...
Why should you care?
Why ... should you care?
Tell me your name?

It saved my father!
Very deep ... usually ...
No.
You mean if just one person gets killed?
I know!
He wants to kill us.
What's it all about?
What?
Where does it all get us, grandpa?
Who have you been talking to?
I met this girl ...
It's always the women that start the trouble.
She got me thinking ...
So? what'd you do to her?
That's my boy!
Sorry.
Sorry!
Make your mind up.
You may need a real berserk.
Row!
The sun! that's it!
What `` magic''?
You'll see!
Look out!
We do n't have to help anybody.

Keitel blacksmith?
But how could he know ... unless ...
But ...
How about making friends?

We have n't got a spare place.
Death!
She must have a knife or something ...
Is this hy-brasil?
Let me do something for myself for a change!
I have to go ...

Do what?
Vanish into thin air?

Mum! dad!
Got you!
What are you talking about?
I'm not worth risking your life for.
I ... i ...
What are you doing, keitel blacksmith?
Get away, snorri.
What have you got there?
The age of ragnarok ends ...
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
That's right.
The blacksmith's code says i must ...
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
Together we stand!
You ca n't let erik do that.
Well ... i ... i thought ...

You do it!
Relax!

She knows it was our fault!
Keep your mouth shut, keitel!
Like you got rid of snorri!
I know, dad.
You went berserk ...
So did my father and his father before him.
But it's a responsibility ...
But it's a responsibility being a berserk.
I must only let the red rage ...
I must kill! kill!
It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
Stop it!
Death to dragons!
Sh!
I'm just building up to it, dad.
Give us a chance, dad!
Helpless ...
Easy, dad!
I hate you! i hate you!
Neither am i.
Me too.
I'm not frightened ... of anything ...
You'll see my grandfather in valhalla!
No ... he's not ... not ... there ...
Tell him i'm coming!

And something to sharpen them with?
Yes, mum.
And keep your sword greased.
Yes, mother. goodbye, dad.
I hope you feel better, sweetie.

And i did n't have an argument.
Come up and see me ... now.
It's very late.
Yes, exactly. exactly my point.
Is that what you want?
I did it. i guess that means something.
Not yet. not married.

There must be a way! what about engineering?
Can you shut it down?
Hurry.

Hear what?
Oh god ...
Nothing. it's nothing.
A power drain --
Pressure?
90 over 50 and falling ....
He's crashing ...
What's on your mind?
The dark inside me.
Starck!
I built it.
Start the countdown.
Justin.
Skipper, you got ta help me ...
Starck, you still showing those readings?
There's no one here, skipper.
What you got, peters?
Alive?
Frozen.
Crystallized.
Skipper ...
Peters ...

Yeah. i'm -- i'm okay.
Justin.
That's what we're here to find out.
Negative.
They're empty, dr. weir. moving forward.
If it worked, yes.
The date.
What about it?
I do n't know.
You said this ship creates a gateway ...
Yes ...
Where has it been for the past seven years?
I do n't know ...
You ca n't, your orders are specific ...
It's done.
Watch me.
Then who the fuck are you?
You know.

Dr. weir ...!

Where is it?
Starck, give me a read.
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
We have a situation here ...
We do n't have time to fart.
Captain, we got a problem.
Now what?
What is it, smith?
Come again, skipper?
Smith? smith! fuck!
Let's go.
I just finished drying ...
Radiation interference?
Keep your eyes open.
We're all here.
But you can breathe it.
Oxygen is not the problem.
Carbon dioxide?
No. it was someone else.
Who?
What is it, starck?
What's going on in there, starck?
Justin's in the airlock.
Whatever was on that bridge was n't weir.
Blow it up?
No. i'll be right back.
He's dead ...
Yes.
He served on the goliath.
Was n't that ship destroyed?
Can you see a body?
There's no one here.
I did.
Not according to the computer.
Can you shut it down?
Keep him talking.
Do you know what it was?
Come on, baby-bear, open this door ...
It's cold.
I do n't care.
Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
She's not ugly.
We're losing atmosphere ...
Range 3000 meters and closing.
Explosive decompression.
Decompression would n't do that.
Get them back --
I'm trying, goddammit --
Wrong. the shortest distance between two points ...
Ship's log.
Yes.
It wants me. i have to go.
The forward airlock.
Relax, it's casual.
I mean ...
The suit will stretch. you should try it --
I would n't be caught dead in that.
Oh, he did.
What did he do to the uniform?!
Victor must've taken him.
I'm worried about you.
About me? how sweet.
What is this? where's reed?
Where do you think? with sue.
I already got it. everything i want.
Ben. this is business. just work.
I had it at four.
This makes five.
He's made a few changes.
Should?
Ben. this is serious. turn around.
Reed, i'm not talking about debbie.
Well maybe you should date him.
Ben. are you okay?
Yeah, nine years straight.
O-kay. we'll skip that question.
Yeah. i can tell. victor was right.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Do n't you wander off, boy.
They're fine. everybody else ... is fine.
Go back to the drawing board.
That's terrible news ...
So are you!
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
Stay right. left is trouble.
I though we went over this.
Last one down springs for room service.
Not this again --
No: you're on fire!

Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
Hilarious.
Reed, we're running out of time.
Ben did this?
I understand the business reasons.
Raising the shields.
You ca n't leave them out there.
Victor, are you feeling alright?
Just find him.
Oh, i think you already have.
Arnold. what's happening?
Of course.

Do n't worry about it.
Totally.

They're not home yet.
Where did you hear that?
I'm just guessing.
Well ... it's true.
Why?
I do n't know. i was just curious.
Maybe yes. maybe no.
You are a virgin!
I did n't say that.
But your face did!
Maybe yes. maybe no.

This whole thing is a joke!
Stay calm, please.
Really? any problems?
Oh for christ's ...
Huh?
Sedate her.
Good! because, brothers, that's you!
Yes.
I was watching.
And he drove me to mine.
Then why weep for him?
The music? or the fire?
Why?
Worse.
Yes. i have been seeking my friends.
Friends? do they live around here?
Yes. very close
Why do you not go to them?
I am afraid.
You speak.
Kill you? hardly that.
How dare you. you're disgusting and evil.
Evil? do you believe in evil?
I see it before me.
Then perhaps i believe in evil after all.
There is something i want. a friend.
Friend?
Yes. i want this over and done with.
I'll be waiting. and watching.
Her body pleases me.
A brain. extremities.
This was not taken from a grave.
I will not! kill me now!
She's not for you.
There, there ... shhh ...
Scandalous! what would your dear mother say?
And you look so lovely.
I should go. i should leave today.
Fine.
Is he not back yet?
Are n't you?
Nothing can. not ever.
Father's so proud.
And you?
You will. what do you want, victor?
All my life i've known.

I wish to be your husband.
I wish to be your wife.
I will be here when you return.
Not as weak as i.
Your decision. for us.
I give you my soul ...
Elizabeth. my more than sister.
I'm all right. i'm safe,
Now husband and wife.

No ... they said she was here ...
Josh!? why would she be with josh?
I do n't know.
Why? what did she tell you?
Did she say that?
On that pathetic fake blind date.
What are you talking about?
Yes?
Do you have a check for me?
Let me see the sick.
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
There is no reason for fear.
As are they all.
Am i to take it you want to live?
Most certainly. absolutely. yes.
How; we do n't know where they are?
You'll need your confidence, i promise you.
How could it be? i hate africa.
Do n't they, though?
So work must be going well?
Starling?
Well, i need to speak to him.
Then why do it?
Nigel and i do n't like each other much.
You intend `` sorting this out'' tonight?
We have hunted since childhood.
Might be exciting for you.
So that's what a lion looks like.
That's what the books say ...
You mean nobody died?
What did i do?
Got me out of trouble.
We need to talk.
Samuel says you killed a lion.
Has it ever done that before?
... do n't know ...
Have you ever failed?
Only in life ...
I got big.
Good luck.
Why?
Because i think they're after you.
Clearly you do n't agree about building the railroad?
You- they can not believe you're still here.
Nonsense.
Look out, samuel, here it comes.
Thank you, samuel.
Good news?
I expect so- it's from my wife.
Do you love her?
I do, actually; very much.
You give me hope, john.
Oh yes. but it takes time.
You've known him long?
Since his beard was red.
Once ...
Underneath. somewhere.
It's all right, samuel- we all get hit-
Four should do it.
They will want a lot of money.
Not even close. what happened?
Hold your son high.
Okay, i'll take a raincheck on that.
Oh no.
Do you ever see him?
Occasionally
How is he these days?
No. not that i can recall.
Thank you.
Okay, that's no problem.
That's exactly what you said last week.
Oscar! you poor kid!
I'll supervise.
Okay, let's take a look.
Thanks.
Oh, hello, peter.
You're really good, you know.
Same difference.
Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
Ghostbusters.
I do n't think we should leave her alone.
You're right. we should stay.
None
I know.
Then why have you come?
Yes, the scourge --
-- the sorrow of moldavia --
-- the sorrow --
I command you.
I await the word of vigo.
Who are they?
You've got to stop them. please!
Yes.
Get on with it, counselor!
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
You were the one who got me in.
Objection. irrelevant and immaterial.
Hello, venkman.
I knew that.
You need the exercise.
They came from ostrov in eastern poland.
Why do n't we try the giga-meter?
His nickname is `` the hammer.''
And we're the ...
That's it. it's on the bottom.
Nine feet -- ten --
Do it! just do it!
No, the slime is rising.
And it's all flowing toward the museum.
There's something very familiar about this painting.
So, no goat hooves, huh?
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Who?
Who? just -- someone we know.
Oh, ray --
Aaah! nobody! i ca n't tell you!
Who, ray?
Dana! dana barrett!
Okay, let's heat'em up!
I'm peter --
I hate jello.
She's new in town.
I'm ready.
Then let's do it.
Huh? what?
You finished here?
What? yeah.
No, i just thought --
Well do n't think!
And decent.
Wonder what?
Nice going, honey. it was brand new.
I did n't break your precious clock, roy!
To the bathroom, where do you think?
Have i done the right thing?
What's the matter, dear?
Ummm -- figure eight?
Hi, louis.
... i thought it was the drug store.
Are you sick, louis?
Hi, louis.
I am zuul.
Barrett. dana barrett.
It's in the stars.
That's a violin concerto.
No? what do i act like?
Like a used car salesman.
Thanks. what's in there?
What?
Nothing. is that the kitchen?
Well, let's check it out.
I'll wait here if you do n't mind.
I told you, i ...
I know. it happened by itself.
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah.
I think i should spend the night here.
That's it. get out.
On a purely scientific basis.
Out!
I want to help you.
I'll scream.
Do n't scream.
Then leave.
Okay. then i'll go.
Goodbye.
No kiss?
You heard it?
You're the best one in your row.
Whoa!! nice voice.
Back off, man! i'm a scientist!
We'll get back to you.
Oh, that's very- unusual.
I think it's the food of the future.
Remind me not to go to lunch with you.
In the physical sense.
What is it?
Are you peter venkman?
Yes, i'm doctor venkman.
I see. and now you catch ghosts?
You could say that.
And may i see this storage facility?
No, you may not.
And why not, mr. venkman?
Because you did n't say the magic word.
And what is the magic word, mr. venkman?
The magic word is `` please.''
Why do you want to see it?
A square?
Good guess -- but no.
Close -- but definitely wrong.
Yes. i do n't like this.
Sorry. this is n't your day.
They're not guns. they're particle throwers.
Were you recently in the bathroom?
What on earth gave you that idea?
What have you got, egon?
Wow!
Yeah, i can smell it.
Do n't cross the beams.
Why not?
Trust me. it will be bad.
What do you mean `` bad?''
Oh, shit!
Who?
Gozer.
You talked to gozer?
But it's my favorite state.
We'd better adjust our streams.
Looked at with your eyes.
What do we do now?
I do n't know. talk to it.
What do i say?
Anything! just make contact.
To go into business for ourselves.
No sense worrying about it now.
Where are you, pete?
Third floor. get down here,
Sit tight. i'm on my way.
How do you know?
I do n't know. i'm just guessing.
He's listed on the blueprints as i. shandor.
Forget the trapping! just blast him!
Look!
Me, too.
Do you believe in god?
No. but i liked jesus' style.
Right. and the sky would fall ...
Judgement day ...
Yeah, judgement day.
Later, man!!
That's what you told me two days ago!
For the gods, spit it out!
Why not do it in the colosseum?
You're coming back?
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
Not yet, dear brother ...
Send them out!
Perhaps, master galen, you may say.
Gladly caesar.
That this illness has clouded his mind.
Apparently my opinion was n't needed.
I'm serious.
So am i.
He left us at dawn.
Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?
Jerses -- tomorrow ...
But have never been?
We all know what right is, senator.
My loyalties ... were in doubt.
Would that marcus had lived.
They fear me.
As soon as i can.
On your honor as a roman officer, daddy?
On my honor as your daddy ...
Well, they die for it!
I was summoned.
Is n't the helmet magnificent?
They're studying with cynics.
Of course ...
I can see that ...
Quintus is overly idealistic.
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
Chain him.
-- to fight? we'll see ...
That's one way to look at it.
As, what,'the galloping gladiator?!'
Then get a large cash advance.
Right, right, what am i thinking of?
Hello.
Do you know what you're going to do?
No.
Are you going to graduate school?
No.
Yes.
I'd love some.
No.
Why not?
No -- why should i?
I do n't know.
No.
I'm sorry i took you in there.
I think i'd better go home now please.
But, elaine --
Where is the car?
I just want to tell you something.
But could i just tell you this one thing?
What?
No, i could n't.
But could you try?
No.
Wait a minute.
Is anything wrong?
Of course not.
Yes.
Yes.
With a family?
Yes. she had a husband and a son.
Did they ever find out?
No.
And it's all over now.
Yes.
I'm glad.
You sure you really want to?
Yes.
You do?
Benjamin -- i really do.
Hurry up. put your shoes on.
Because i want to know what's happening.
That woman --
What?
That woman. the older woman.
You mean the one who --
Oh my god --
Get out!
Do n't cry.
Get out of here.
Ah. where?
At the zoo.
No.
Oh.
Yes.
Here he comes.
What?
Come in.
Is it because i'm here?
What do you think?
I think it is.
All right then! yes!
Well, i want you to leave.
Elaine -- i love you.
How could you do that, benjamin?
I do n't understand --
Did you say rape her?
Let me go.
You've got to tell me what she said.
Because it is n't true.
I do n't feel well.
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
Elaine -- that is not what happened.
If you want.
My belt.
Do n't you have it on?
I do n't know.
No.
Well -- where are you going?
I do n't understand.
Goodbye.
What?
Will you kiss me!
I do n't know.
But you might.
I might.
Is that so? you might marry me?
Yes.
When?
I do n't know.
We just can.
I have to go back now.
I'll think about it.
You really will?
Yes.
Why would n't it?
I just do n't think it would ...
Carl who?
Yes.
Why do you have to see him?
Well -- i said i might marry him.
Shhhh.
Where did he do it?
No.
The day after tomorrow?
Maybe we are and maybe we are n't.
What?
Hello -- who is this?
This is dr. smith's answering service.
Is the doctor anywhere?
I certainly hope you --
Excuse me. mr. mcquire.
Ben.
Mr. mcquire.
Are you listening?
Yes i am.
Plastics.
Okay. enough said. that's a deal.
Not exactly.
I said -- not exactly -- no.
What are you then?
Well -- i'm just sort of traveling through.
What?
One of those outside agitators.
Oh -- no sir.
Who screamed?
It's all right, mr. mccleery.
You heard me. out of here.
What for?
Because i do n't like you.
Could i make one phone call first?
Get out!
Yes.
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
I have to go now. i'm sorry.
I'm in the bathroom.
Well here's the purse.
Could you bring it up?
Well i'll hand it to you.
Will you bring it in to me?
I'd rather not.
Uh -- the taft hotel.
Did you get a room?

The singleman party, sir?
Oh -- yes. the singleman party.
It's in the main ballroom.
Ahh -- thank you.
A single. just for myself, please.
Will you sign the register, please?

Luggage? yes. yes. i do.
Where is it?

Please wait till my husband gets home.
When is he coming back?

What do you mean?
What?
Did you know that?
Look -- i think i should be going --
Sit down, benjamin.
What?
My husband will be back quite late.
Pardon?
Oh no, mrs. robinson, oh no.
What's wrong?
What do you think?
Well i do n't know.
Mrs. robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.
Have you ever seen elaine's portrait?
Her portrait?
Yes.
No.
Benjamin?
Yes?
Will you unzip my dress?
Oh. well, goodnight.
Wo n't you unzip my dress?
I'd rather not, mrs. robinson.
I know that. but i'm --
Come on.
Right.
I'm not scared, mrs. robinson.
Then why do you keep running away?
What?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
On that chair in the hall.
Get away from that door.
I want to say something first.
Jesus christ!
Do you understand what i said?
Yes. yes. let me out!
Because i find you very attractive and any time --
I've got to go.
Yes.
Thank you for taking me home.
Oh. hello. hello.
Of course.
Very well. thank you.
A drink? of course.
Waiter!
What?
Have you gotten us a room yet?
I have n't. no.
Do you want to?
Now?
Yes.
Well -- i do n't know.
Why do n't you get it.
That's fine.
Yes -- i think that would be good.
I'll be up in five minutes.
Well -- goodbye then --
Benjamin.
Yes?
Is n't there something you want to tell me?
To tell you?
Yes.
What?
Benjamin.
Yes?
Oh -- sure. thank you.
What?
A hanger.
What?
Wood or wire? they have both.
Either one will be fine.
Okay.
You're welcome.
Mrs. robinson -- i ca n't do this.
You what?
This is all terribly wrong.
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
Is this -- what?
Are you kidding?
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
Wait a minute!
On your first time --
Who said it was my first time?
That you're afraid --
Wait a minute.
Good. i mean are we dead or something?
Anything. anything at all.
Well?
Do n't you?
You're not interested in art?
No.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
I do n't.
Yes i do.
I got up.
What?
What novel did you read.
I do n't remember.
What?
There's no risk?
I walk out.
You walk right out the door.
He's asleep.
Always?
Benjamin, this is n't a very interesting topic.
We're talking.
What?
Now let's keep going here.
Can i undress and talk at the same time?
Right.
Thank you.
Well how long has this been going on.
About five years.
Oh no. are you kidding me?
No.
Is it?
But you do n't hate him.
I do n't.
What?
I never did, benjamin. now let's --
Well, wait a minute. you married him.
See if you can guess.
Well i ca n't.
Think real hard, benjamin.
Was he a law student at the time?
Yes.
At college.
Yes.
What was your major?
Why are you asking me all this?
Art?
Well how did it happen?
How do you think.
I'm curious.
We'd go to his car.
Oh no. in the car you did it?
I do n't think we were the first.
What?
Do you remember the make of the car?
Oh my god.
Really. i want to know.
It was a ford, benjamin.
So old elaine robinson got started in a ford.
Do n't talk about elaine?
No.
Why not?
Because i do n't want you to.
There's nothing to tell.
I was just kidding around.
Good.
But why should n't i?
I have my reasons.
Then let's hear them.
No.
Well, i'm not.
You're not.
You're goddamn right i am.
Now do n't start this.
What?
Do n't start acting hurt.
Of course you did.
Of course i would n't.
But it's not.
Yes. please. i want you to.
Thank you.
This is absurd.
Promise me, benjamin.
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
How?
Then you'd better start believing me.
I just do n't believe you would do that.
Where is elaine?
I do n't think so.
Sir?
The toothbrush. i got it all right.
Very good, sir.
Yes. well -- goodnight.
Goodnight, sir.
Yes, but i'm afraid --
Hello, mrs. robinson.
Sure.
What else?
Nothing else.
I do.
You believe me, do n't you?
No.
You do n't?
Oh, ben -- this is so -- exciting --
No -- they do n't.
Well -- when did you decide all this?
About an hour ago.
We have n't.
-- worried?
Well --
About what?
I guess -- about my future.
What about it?
Different.
No.
I'm going to marry elaine robinson.
Yes, sir.
Oh no.
What?
I've got to go.
Ben -- how old are you now?
Twenty. i'll be twenty-one next week.
You'll never be young again.
I know.
Ben, can i say something to you?
What?
How long have we known each other now?
I've watched you grow up, ben.
Yes, sir.
Great.
Why?
It should n't make any difference what happened.
That's quite a statement.
Do n't shout at me, ben.
Mrs. robinson?
Yes?
It's benjamin.
Yes?
Benjamin braddock.
Benjamin -- where are you?
Can you look through the glass.
Yes, i can.
They are? come on.
Ben says he and elaine are getting married.
I do n't believe it.
That what he says. right?
Not now.
Yes, sir.
And what are you going to do?
The pearls are in her room.
Need any help?
No.
Have you got that skeleton key?
Why?
How?
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you ...
No -- no -- no -- no ...
Why?
No --
With the pearls --
You ca n't.
I'll pay you back.
How?
I have an idea working in my head ...
You might find a bullet through that head ...
Not with strangers.
You're a fool!
Yes, i am rather.
Who?
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
Have you seen it?
You?
Oh -- work!!
Oh!

Will you do me a big favor?
I'll do anything for you.
Would you like to make a man happy?
Yes -- i'd love to.

I feel sorry for him.
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
Yes --
You live here?
For tonight.

Well -- such is life, flaemmchen.
And baron, thanks so much for everything.
What do you want here?
Nothing -- only to be here.

Certainly.
How tired you are!
Yes -- tired ...
So alone.
Strange man ...
Am i quite strange to you?
He disappeared. later he was found dead.
You are beautiful!
No.

On the train?
Yes -- i will be on the train.
Till then.

You're sweet.
You think so?
Here, hold up!
Why not?
They turn out marvelous material in manchester.
No water -- what a place!
All you have to do is phone for it.
Of course you took the initiative.
And i said we did n't.
You've decided against the merger?
Yes --
Then, it's all over?
Yes --
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
Under these circumstances we might refuse to sign.
As you remember it -- when you approached us ...
We did not approach you.
He likes to play the great man.
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
You see -- what we are interested in --

We thought a doctor might help.
Your old beau?
We thought it was an emergency.
He's a very decent man, harold.
We all are.
Should n't you lie down?
When i'm dead -- or fucking.
Paul said you were awfully sick.

Sneaking in the back door.
If he wants to go.
You took him to the funeral, i hear.
It's a big and busy funeral home.
Did you like it, dear?
Almost a christmas scene.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
Just one favor.
If he thinks he's man enough.
No you do n't.
What a handsome word.
No.
Do n't!
Stop!
There it is. give it to me.
Load it for her.

Now who's being cruel?
And terror, if you do n't mind.

Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
I hate crowds, and i have no charisma --
You're too modest.
I'm utterly satisfied.
We never quit fighting until we're dead.

New lives begin!
Use the sanitary facilities, if i may.
Leave the rifle here.

There was so much going on.
She married an accountant named stanley kestenbaum.
Jesus.
Alice is dead?
What will you do, colonel?
I'm only ten years old.
I heard you were looking for me.
You were harold ryan's third wife. right?
Yes.
Premature ejaculation.
Something's made you sore.
Do n't worry about it.
Do n't!
What a relief!
I do n't want to live any more.
Stay home tonight!
Oh, paul --
He's alive!

There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
I do n't get it.
It is you, is n't it, harold?
Dr. woodly? you know who this is?

Yeah.
Then get him.
Okay.
You're taking mom out tonight?
You're going out?
Oh?

We're leaving.
Where's my father?
Sure.
Do you really need this bed, lady?
Uh-huh.
Got her mother's looks.
Her mother's dead.
Julia's my second wife.
Lucky man.
It's just a puzzle box.
You did this before, right?
Many times.
To a man called frank cotton?
He did. i've seen him.
No. that was n't the deal.
Stay the fuck away from me.
You can keep them.
I have to speak to my father.
I do n't remember.
Kirsty?
You remember.
No.
Come to daddy.
One last time. give me the box.

Keep your voice down.
You're hurting.

Tell me, damn you.
You promised me an explanation.
A box?
You would be. they tore me apart.
So you were cheated.
I do n't.
So where's the harm?
I said no.
Maybe.
Do n't you care?
There's very little i can do about it.
Maybe we should just leave --
Like this? look at me! like this?
Well we ca n't just stay here --
I need a skin. then we leave --
Hi. i got soaked.
There's a towel in the bathroom.
Which is where?
Just to your left.
The keys are in the kitchen.
Where's daddy?
What's the problem?
I have to see my father.
Of course. there's no need to shout.
I was here this afternoon.
This afternoon.

Oh my god.
We're going to freeze to death.
O.k. o.k.

So what's the argument?
No argument.
Oh christ. julia ...

What's wrong with you?
Do n't go upstairs.
Come with me then.
Please ...
What's wrong with you?
Please. i ca n't bear it ...
I do n't know where to begin ...
What are you talking about?
It's better you see for yourself --
What?
Drinking alone.
Not much.
I wonder, maybe ...
Just soda.

Claymore.
Huh?
It's in good condition.
It's my birthday.
Happy birthday.
Thanks.
No thank you, i'm fine.
Why?
No.
Carl smith.
You owe me. besides, i'm cute.
Yes.
Very traditional.
It's not mine.
Basil the ii.
Good day, miss cartwright.
Probably.
Who?
People like that rarely leave business cards.
Does carl smith?
I've been to church hill.
I doubt that. good day, miss cartwright.
Tradition.
What the hell is going on?
Where?
Dupont circle.
At the moment? carl smith.
And you?
Not your concern.
He was innocent.
You?
No.
You are being foolish.
Are you?
No one knows you're here?
No. i had to talk to you.
You're wrong.
You're a fool.
Maybe.
You've been listening to rumors.
Not all of them.
When you finish, what then?
I wish i could.
Yes.
Well, as long as we're stuck here.
A little dusty.
Yes.
And you are william taupin, are n't you?
Yes.
At least.
That's impossible.
I hope i never get that old.
You wo n't.
I'm not even sure why.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
Just a little crazy.
That would be difficult to explain.
I'd like you to try.
Yes.
He knows about you.
He is older than i.
Perhaps. there is something more. an inheritance.
Of bodies.
I did n't kill the watchman.
You killed those other two.
Not the same.
Sometimes innocents become involved.
You kill with your left hand?
I have n't killed _you_.
Is that a threat?
Come here, brenna.
Damn you.
All of it finished.
No!
Not power. not control.
I'm just curious.
Call your mother. you never call her.
You and i should talk first.
We've got nothing to say.
All fashionably without heads.
Spare me the details.
I want taupin.
What makes you so sure he's the one?
It's that important?
Yeah.
Why?
What are you doing man?
You'll not be bringing the church into this.
Stop.
Stop!
Your name is conor?
Aye.
You're not from these parts.
I was nearly killed.
But you lived.
It was time for our paths to cross.
Does it change with me in the room?
It is less.
You feel you know me.
I do n't know why.
We are brothers.
You are still so very young.
I'm twenty-two.
Not even a single lifetime.
We are immortal.
No!
This is madness!
It is the truth.
No!
You are not dead, boy. accept it.
Me arm hurts.
Again. try again.
Go to hell.
Muy bien!
It's like to kill me first.
I have no future husband.
Who?
You're not talking sense, mara!
What would you like?
Something pretty.
Like you.
Kiss me.
Do you have cause to bothering us?
Certainly not me.
Tradition.
It's all we have.
Romirez is dust.
Finish yours?
Mulet.
Second musketeer.
You seem to understand a great deal.
If you wish to play games, major.
We have no understanding.
It never changes, major.
Stay out of it.
Do n't threaten me, private.
I had no choice.
Have you time for some- thing to eat?
He's a macleod.
My father taught me.
Your father must be smart.
Yes, he was.
Yeah.
I do n't know.
What name is he using?
How many came?
The last four.
And the bulgarian?
He got him. he always does. eventually.
He knows i'm here. how?
Kahn?
Head still secure to the neck.
How did you find me?
He always did.
You're insane.
Not so long.
Of sorts.
I do hope she enjoys a good show.
Macleod!
As you wish.
This is n't done. get up.
It's all we have.
Go to hell.
Leave her alone.
Get up.
Are you here?
I want you to come to me.
And if i refuse?
Should i care?
Yes.
No.
That's none of your business.
You're wrong.
I presume it's a sword.
For the moment.
Where were you tuesday night?
Home.
A neighbor saw your car leave.
He's mistaken.
All i need is time.
But i had heard his wounds were mortal.
His only kid.
The resemblance is amazing.
When may i expect the cleaners?
I'll send them right up.
Same.
Just your pappy scared some.
Hildy!
I'm getting married tomorrow.
Well, congratulations! good luck!
What's the idea of locking this?

To the hotel. to register.
Without your pants.
Maybe they wo n't stand on ceremony.
I made it work.
Yeah. i did it.
What are you looking at?
This ... is not going to work out.
Not blue enough.
It is my business. it's my name.
Why not?!
You want sophistication, it do n't come cheap.
Does n't.
The beautiful one.
You have no taste.
That place. by the window.
The drinks ... stay on them.
Are you serious?
Just hold them close and stay still.
The blond ... gruner. a killer.
Killer!
I do n't know what's going on.
How do you know?
Voice stress analyzer.
She's the toughest to read.
Maybe she's telling the truth.
This just wo n't work.
You're doing great with her.
Not her. you!
What is it?
What if she says something important?
You got any books in there?
Oh come on.
You shut down your sensors.
Joe! it's 56 hours!
I do n't know!
Shit! you're in love.
It was n't like that.
Why do n't you get out of my face.
You found her.
Better. i found ryuji.
Osaka?
Fountainhead of high-tech.
Follow her.
On what?
Run, stupid!
I ca n't keep up.
That's not funny.
Just stay here and rest.
Where are you going?
What do i do?
Relax. let me do this.
I told you, i have a feeling ...
One of your instincts?
Do n't worry!
Too late.
Drink lots of water.
You have to! quickly!

A hard left. a hard left.
I ca n't see a thing.
Neither can they.
Never mind, just say it.
None
You were with gruner!
I do n't trust her.
Come on.
I've got an idea.
I was afraid of that.
Not sure at all.
Haka xuki. what's that mean?
Cash.
Well ...?
While he makes the run.
Where?
I ca n't handle that thing.
Do n't worry, i can.
Aim what?
... shit! it's just money.
And do n't let her know, either.
What exactly?
I do n't know.
Losing power. the laser drained it.
Where've you been?
Never mind that, where are we now.
Looks like you can have all you want.
Keep thinking.
I have been ... i think you're right.
About what?
She works for them.
Now, you're too suspicious.
You've changed your mind.
Yeah, sure.
Are n't we all.
It'll remind me of you.
What part what?
The best part. she'll love it.
Do n't give her your name.
Oh, i ca n't.
Good.
I insist.
Do n't worry.
Let us get to the border!
Then what?
Joe's escaped. dieter's in him.
In him?
It's a long story.
What a nerve!
Me.
Then how did you know?
I dyed it. we're all getting old.
They took the tapes.
You have nothing ...
Does n't matter. then put him away.
Sir?
We met on the beach.
Join us.
That crazy guy?
Yes. joe.
He's not an ordinary man.
Enough romance.
We insist.
That name's familiar.
It is to me too.
And how do you service foreigners.
I think i've heard of you.
Your memory.
What about it?
It may have been affected.
Oh.
You may not remember things.
What things?
When you do ...

When you remember ...
Remember what?
Who ... are you?
Fine. you look fine.

If i was with you, i would n't
You did.
And how'm i doing?
You're doing ... okay.

No. ryuji just hires us.
Hires you for what?
That depends ...
Why'd you run off?
They left. i had to go with them.
Why did n't you tell me?
Wanted to get to know you.
Why?
You seemed interesting.
Who else is interested in me?
What do you mean?
Your friends, did they ask about me?
What did you tell them?
There's not much to tell.
Why did they leave?
Sometimes. i told you i did.

You lost the charge?
He was chasing me!
Close the fucking door!

Then what's he talking about?
Homesearchers.
I'm positive.
You're a lying bastard!

What do you mean, stand out?
Did anyone look suspicious? think!
Who is this?
Just a second. hello?
To get your attention.
Did you know her?
No, only the path she chose to travel.
You'll find her.
Not really.
Why her?
Because she's the type.
But you said you did n't know her.
I could n't say it any better than huxley.
Very good.
The police have n't told you?
You sonofabitch!
Emotional? i expected more from you.
I've figured out the message.
The game's over. you lost.
It's me you want. not her.
Very good. how did you know?
The pipes.
Set up some pieces on the big board?
He's in his seventies and lives in holland.
New york. 1986. viktor yurilivich.

You're safe. he would n't come here.
He already did once.
Why did he what?
Come here.
He was watching you.
Uh huh.
I'm kathy.

Six, eight hours tops.
Any sign of rape?
No prints.
You mean, no prints but hers?
No frank. no prints.
Yeah.
How long she been dead?
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
What do you think he did?
It's important.
That's a big area to cover.
About a quarter to one.
What does that mean?
You do n't have a shred of evidence!
Do you know how she found the apartment?
Through a rental agency.
Here. i played gregory lutz.
Are we going to go through this again?
Answer the question.
I went out.
Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
I want to be the best i can.
Just thought you might want to talk.
About what?
Whatever's on your mind.
Who says something's on my mind.
Mate in five.
Exactly ... and you did this.
Feel like practicing?
Yeah. just let me grab a shower.
We'll call you back.
It's alright.
Yes.
Uh huh.
Are you one of the players?
Yes.
It seems like such a complicated game.
Do you always open quickly?
Are we talking about me, or chess?
You.
Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
Getting too hot in here for you?
Nothing. i just came in for a steam.
No you did n't.
She could be dead now.
I do n't think i could.
It was n't intentional.
Another kind of game?
In a way.
This is n't a game.
Do you?
Let's change the subject.
That's not fair!
Why?
Because i work with them.
You're not?
How could you? unless you were there.
You know, andy thinks you're doing this.
Does n't that scare you?
No.
Why?
Because i think he's wrong.
No. but i'm open to distractions.
I'm sure you are.
No. you were talking about chess.
Alright. what about me?
I dunno. where's erica mother?
She died in a car accident.
I'm sorry.
It was.
And you?
Yes you are. you're playing word games.
What is this?
Then show me who you are.
Call room service.
What do you want on it?
You.
Would you settle for pepperoni?
The line was busy. i'll try again.
I tried again and got through.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Then why are you backing up?
Exactly. it's the key.
Where's the note?
Can i come in?
Why?
Because she killed herself!!
Why not?
Because i know what it says.
Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
Frank told me.
No he did n't.
He did n't tell you either.
Are you going to come tonight?
Yeah. i'll be there later.
I got lucky.
You're really not bad looking. almost handsome.
Well, you're beautiful.
We're almost married.

I do n't know how.
All directions are the same here.
That way. i can feel the cold.
Yes.
Of course it was.
I wo n't leave you here.
Does the queen live?
The new queen lives.
Turold's son was to marry her.
But there is another entrance to this place.
I am too old to climb down a rope.
You wo n't have to.
Reach out farther. call to her.
Lyssa ... lyssa ...

He has come for lyssa.

She can see the beast!
Use your sword.
It is my fate to die in the fortress.

I forbid you!
We must enter the swamp.
What will happen?
You have done it?
I road them often in my youth.
Saddles.
Yes. it is today.
Each to his fate.
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
I do n't think that.
Yes.
Am i not beautiful enough to be loved?
Yes.
Even by you?
Yes.
I ache with it.
Let me comfort you.
I can not take comfort when she has none.
Then give me comfort. sleep with me tonight.
I can not betray my bride.
I can not.
Staying alive.
He saved our lives.
My< u> friend< /u>.
I have need of friends.
What else is left for a man without friends.
How did you know i had sons?
I know you.
To the place where death lives.
It should be an interesting journey, then.
That i promise you.
I'm all right.
Not sleepy, either?
No.
We must try to get horses.
What kind of friend do you think i am?
Yes, my lord.
Those beasts can not be saddled by mortal men.
At the gallop!
Naturally.
Would you settle for a boar?
Me. may i eat with you tonight?
We'll meet you at the inn.

One puppy? why not wish for a hundred?
I only want one.
A foolish wish. and you, quell?
You had better manners as a pig.
Food for crows.
Oh, my poor stomach.
Look at its insides.
No. he will master the leader.
Then look!
Then he will die!
Yes.
That i am, my lady.
A match for your son, i think.
A fine match.
Yes. we lost five.
You were lucky. i lost thirty there.
With an old voice?
You know the voice.
I will seek the fortress for you.
Yes. it is the western ocean.

The most beautiful woman in the world.
But you would not stay with me.
No, she was not as beautiful.
She bore you many children?

I have a 4.0.
I ca n't tell you.
You understand you're on trial for murder?
Go to hell.
I'll take that as a no.
Are we done for today?
I believe we are.
What?
You're fired. i have new representation.
Who?
He thinks i'm guilty, does n't he?
That's not what's important.
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
How?
Enrique's gay. i'm sure of it.
No.
Was there any evidence that mrs. windham shot him?
His dead body with a bullet in it.
No, she'd stashed it by then.
No. i was in the shower.
Yes.
Who's askin'?
I'm elle woods. ms. bonafante's attorney.
Thank you!
Is everything okay?
About the alibi --
You're a beautiful girl, elle.
So everything you just said --
I'm a man who knows what i want.
Yes, i am.
No, she was crying her eyes out.
What?
See?
Aristotle.
How about --
I do n't know.
Spill.
No.
How'd it go at the trial?
Licensed attorney or family member?
Uh -- family.
Relation?
I'm her sister.
Name?
Delta. gamma.
You know her?
I know. he has it sent out.
Really?
What?
Yes, you are.
Thank you. i love you, too.
Your scrunchie?
My lucky scrunchie. it helped me pass spanish.
Picking out my wedding dress!
What?!
Josh proposed!
No way --
Not yet.
Did she do that to you, too?
Thanks again for your help!
I was n't gon na --
She's completely untrustworthy.
Why?
But maybe it's not what you think.
But maybe it is --
How do you figure?
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
Fine. sorry i brought it up.
For a butt-head? yes.
What?!
I'm quitting.
Oh, my god!!
Are you asking me on a date?
Is he the only one?
What do you think?
I just do n't understand what went wrong --
I got bangs!
Really --
Why not?
I'd rather have a client who's innocent.
You should. do you have a resume?
I do.
Maybe she found him like that.
Of course, i do!
Has warner huntington checked in yet?
Your what?
So are you!
Then what? my boobs are too big?
Elle -- no -- your boobs are fine --
No.
Elle -- it's twenty miles back to campus.
You go where?
Harvard. law school.
You got into harvard law?
What, like it's that hard?
Do anything exciting?
Thank you. having fun?
Now i am.
Thank you.
See?
Are you serious?
Huh. imagine that. looks like i am.
Yes.
Where?
And what is your boyfriend's name?
Chuck.
Why do you say that?
Have n't you seen the cabana boy?
Where's the rock?
It's not a theta --
Pull up next to him!
Faith.
Anything left for smashing you may happily smash.
I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
Purely a precaution ...
Always.
We go out, smash'em now?
Indeed, the best of fun ... enjoy yourselves.
To finish last evening's delightful work.
What do you want with me?
Your love.
Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
You're magnificent.
Grotesque ... monstrous ...
Not from me, surely ...
You ... you're a beast!
I am afraid of nothing.
To be my bride, of course.
I'd soon die.
We're both of us damned, my beauty.
What do you want from me?
Yes?
What will become of me then?
What? speakee loud! no hear velly good.
It's terrible.
Oh no ... do n't you understand?
To be sure.
What!
Big question that, lad. why what?
If the horn be restored the curse is ended.
No less a creature than the lindfarne worm.
Something's coming.
It would appear so.
Careful, lad.
Aye! that too.
You'll need more than bird droppings for blackheart.
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
Whatever for?
Blackheart?
The foulest. mayhap i can cut them free.
Jack, do n't!
What know you of fields of war?
Beyond devil's needle, all is unknown.
Something the matter?
Ogg's footprints!
Certainly understandable.
Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
There's the way, mates.
It bodes evil.
Willful creature, that one ...
We'll never find the baron's castle.
Nay. this time we strike first!
No ... but what choice have we?
The chill is worse this night.
It feels wrong, jack ... like a trap.
Easily spoken ...
Been telling you that all along, lad.
What magic have we on our side?
That's it!
Then it's godspeed, screwball.
Fire away!
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
Aye. we're good as inside.
It's what we'll find there worries me.
Nonsense! course it matters.
... the princess lili ... i've killed her.
Aye. hurry now, gump, the key!
Mean you to seek him out below?
I'm not afraid of the dark.
Sunlight.
Plan on carrying some away in a kettle?
Patience, lad.
Hurry up!
I could have struck off his head just now!
He'll not escape me.
I've not heard a note out of you.
Not in the mood, i'm afraid.
Listen to him. not in the mood ...
Where's your joy if you can not sing?
Where?
By the pond. she was teasing me.
Go on ... go on ...
No, no, no ... this is different!
Three cheers for our champion.
They've fired the moat!
They'll do nicely.
Sorry.
If you like.
Never.
But you did ... you did!
I may have said perhaps ...
Liar!
Or perchance ...
Oh, fie. what about the unicorn?
Unicorn?
A promise is a sacred oath.
All right. i'll show you something sacred.
A gentleman would offer water.
Be patient.
What's the matter?
Shhh!
Jack!
To fetch your napkin.
My father and the baron.
My own father ...
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
Its powers are strong.
Be it fit for your wife, green jack?
I have no wife.
Then, perchance you'll me.
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
Jack ... forgive me ...
Only what's right ...
I was bewitched ... it's better this way ...
They told me you were dead.
You've freed me, jack ...
Sunlight ... it destroys him.
Sunlight?
That's why he goes masked during the day ...
So, he's hiding in the dark ...
In the dark ... where i join him ...
And i love you, my husband.
Ouch! something's biting me.
Biting you?
Pinching me!
Pinching? where?
Everywhere! ow!
I ca n't see a thing.
Ow! whatever it is, it hurts.
His feet shall never cross my lips.
What became of the princess?
Princess? i know of no princess.
Exceeding fair.
As fair as me?
No!
Dead, dead, dead.
I do n't believe you.
You'll visit again?
As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
I pray god grants it me.
Sorry.
Only that?
And charmed, of course.
Do i not please you, jack?
In every way.
And am i not fair?
Jest with me then.
How so?
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
I'm promised to another!
Please ...
We wait.
I think she's about to foal.
Watch behind or i'll never collect on it!
Small miracles better than no miracles ...
Up ahead!
Bah! you faeries have the morals of ferrets.
It's done ... we'll never catch him.
I slew the lindfarne worm with it.
Achilles wore it before the gates of troy.
May god protect you.
To castle couer de noir?
You've been inside?
In a dream.
What are you doing?
I'm not cheating! i'm not looking!
He was there and then he was n't!
I thought i might stop by.
Since seventh grade.
He's here. check the bathroom.
I checked everywhere. he's not there.
It's so beautiful.
Mom said i should.
Oh.
I would have anyway.
Who are you?
What color?
Red.
I love red! that's my favorite color!
Here, honey!
What's wrong?
And why was the alarm on?
Oh god, we do n't want the police!
I could n't sleep last night.
Uh ... using josh like that.
Has he eaten anything at all?
Who are all these people?
I'll survive.
He seems lonely.
Are you his friend?
No.
Why?
Is that legal?
Nope.
Monday.
What's that?
I need to ask you something, mr. nelson.
Let's shut up and not kill her.
What did you think it would be?
What are you doing here?
I'm supposed to be in tahoe.
Your dad's really gon na build his house?
I do n't know.
I do n't know.
Where's your dad?
He jumped into the ocean.
Tell him i said `` hi''.
You look better without make-up.
I ca n't even take a shower here.
I'll get your back.
No. that's okay.
Yeah.
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
Really?
I wanted him to marry her.
Why?
Turn over.
I can use your mom's.
I'm okay.
I'm coming in.
I do n't want you to!
We're not gon na do anything.
Why are you so stupid?
Why are you so uptight?
Does everything have to have a point?
What are you talking about?
Josh said ...
I'm not gay.
It would help me if i could kiss you.
Are you afraid of heights?
Not if what he left me was real.
Floating to catalina.
What?
Will he talk to me?
No.
It could have been a squirt gun.
You've been good this week.
We've known each other since grade school.
I've been dreading you.
Oh, yes.
And if i enclosed it?
An exhaust system or a window is code.
A sink?
Allowed outside the enclosed area.
I flushed it down the toilet.
Months.
What are you on?
Pardon me?
How much weight have you lost?
He buys and sells the world.
Maybe that's too long.
Maybe ...?
That's too long.
How old are you?
Forty.
I hate this job.
Well, i feel better about this now.
Good. i was hoping for that.
What can i do for you, george?
Well, it's the least i can do.
Yes, it is.
She's out with a friend.
Oh ... okay.
Uh huh.
I did n't recognize you!
I'm sorry.
I want you both to stay.
Thanks, i'd like that. thank you.
You're here early today.
We're getting out of the ground today.
He escaped. he's going back in.
George, this is the third time.
The plumber's due out on friday.
You'll have to explain that to the police.
You were the only neighbor i could tolerate.
I did warn you.
And you thought they might be under her dress?
I do n't know.
To check up on me?
I'll be around to check up on you.
Why would you be there?
Because i live there.
You live in cory's parents' cabin?
I'll get your bag.
You do n't have a choice.
Mom ... please.
I almost saw catalina.
Goodnight.
I warned you yesterday.
No you do n't.
It bugs me.
You're so predictable.
I'd blame you. i want you here.
I'm not doing it!
It'll be fine.
Hey ... hey!
I do n't know.
When are you going to be back?
I do n't know.
A friend of yours is here.
Did you got through my pants?
I might have a solution.
The gloves on the table are for you.
You ca n't make me do a thing.
Sit down for a second.
No.
Hi, mom.
I know. why?
I like how it feels not to feel.
How do you become something you're not?
What would you like to be?
What i'm not.
What are you now?
Nothing.
That's not true.
What do you know about me?
I'm telling you now.
I gave up on you.
Getting high, i guess.
If i asked you to stop, would you?
To hide a black eye.
Why would n't she leave?
After everything he did to you and your mom?
After everything.
That's so weird ...
What's wrong with your back?
I still do n't know what that means.
I still do n't know what that means.
Yes.
Here.
Good for you.
I'd build a house.
I can die trying.
I have n't been touched in years.
Left you this place.
At least your father tried, george.
I know there's an explanation.
God, you look like crap, george.
I want you to find someone for me.
Three.
Oh. sorry.
It's okay.
She needs to be alone, i think.
Because dad left?
She's a little sad, is all.
Ring the bell before you try the door.
Where is he?
Where he always is.
He does n't answer.
Why does he have a lock on his door?
Where have you been for a week?!
Four days. i left to think.
What did you do with your dog?
Kurt's been feeding him.
But you ca n't call me while you think?
Why would they tow your truck?
I was parked in day parking.
Why call me?
Money?
Where will you live?
The garage.
I want him with me.
No, you do n't. trust me.
I'm married.
I drove over and you were gone.
I ca n't leave the house?
Last time you were gone for a week!
Let's go.
Well, for later then.
What?
I used to live here.
The first and the last.
I dreamed about your house last night.
Finished or unfinished?
Oh ... with his ear infection!
You're not well.
My stupid back.
I think so.
This was my very first slow dance.
Watch out for the smile, boys.
I can hire workers to help me.
Going on?
You've never said that before.
I ca n't pick you up.
You bit my finger.
If i were n't married?
I need to know.
I did n't think you'd come today.
Peter left me yesterday.
Left you?
'i'll be in the bedroom.'
What?
So could i.
It's not my back that's killing me.
I'm an idiot to have you up there.
Not a perfect day.
No.
Does alyssa know?
Nothing.
You got any weed?
You got the money?
Do n't even ... i'm there.
I was n't sure.
I could use the money.
Who?
The payoff.
A man he respects.
Is lois still here? i'm starved.
I'll make you something.
It would worry me.
We should take a vacation.
What?
You ca n't go because of sam?
I know.
What are you doing home?
You live a fabulous life, robin.
Despite you.
I never asked for more.
That's the problem.
Please do n't leave me.
Sam took them to a movie.
I'll be in the bedroom.
Take it off.
Either do you.
Hey.
You got a dog?
It's not ours. it's george's.
Why?
No.
I guess i could teach you some things.
Okay.
I did n't go in your room.
Depends on what i'd give up on.
I do n't know what i'm doing.
Yeah.
You could keep it and rent it out?
This is what he wants.
Why?
He'll be gone for his birthday.
What did you say?
Dad said it first.
Can we really help build a house?
Someone stop her!
Yes, it is.
Enough for drinks, popcorn and candy!
Dad's home, already?
In the bedroom.
No, nigger.
Nigger.
That's my girl.
Better make it a week.
She's doing just fine.
And the baby?
He's a big one.
Cost you a pair of nylons.
No, but ...
Then what's the problem?
She got married last month.
Married?
Yes, sir.
I'll be right back.
Goodnight, claude.
Sure, boss.
I'm not your boss. not anymore.
Here!
That's because i've never been here before.
I'm sylvia. what's your name?
I know it begins with a `` c'' ...
I do n't think so.
Sure i do. what's your name again?
Claude banks.
That's right! good old monroe ...
Probably to spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
Nothing.
No, tell me what's so funny.
That's right, a loan officer.
You need collateral.
Like this?
That thing? who'd you steal it from?
My daddy gave me this watch.
Yeah? who'd he steal it from?
What'd you say?
Yeah, i want some pie.
Guess we better get going, huh?
Still got that ten dollars?
He even got my daddy's watch.
He's dead.
What ai n't there?
Winston. his name's winston.
He does it all by himself.
So?
You know what i'm saying.
Forget it.
Gim me that. that does n't concern you.
I'm sure it do n't.
Claude.
Yeah.
I said you're soft.
Let me take a look at that map.
You drew this?!
I'm stuck!
Say what?
I do n't know. who do you want?
Allie reynolds. he's my boy.
Whatever.
Let me see that.
Make'em throw strikes.
That's the way it is.
Then i have nothing left to say to you.
That was five years ago.
Do n't touch that car.
Back to new york for starters.
Hey, there's wilkins!
I said you're soft.
He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
Why the hell not?
You did n't get ketchup?
Gim me that damn thing.
They're touching.
I'm sorry, he's on medication ...
I'm all right.
You ever done time before?
I try to moisturize regularly.
How about some steak sauce?
No problem. oh, boy!
Why ai n't that pick swinging?
Move it out.
Movin' it out, boss.
Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers up.
What happened to'em after that, willie?
Of course nobody believed ray and claude.
Rayford!
It'll be too late.
I prefer bourbon.
She give you that scar, too?
Like you shot winston hancock?
Jenny?
Anybody else need anything read?
Satchmo.
Me? willie long.
What are you in for, willie?
That's a long story ...
You found him.
Blacks welcome there?
Puerto rican rum. see for yourself.
You should n't have come here.
Please, get out of my mind!
I hear a train coming. drink.
Absolutely not.
It's just such a slap in the face.
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
I am concentrating. where can we rule?
What do you think about ... earth?
You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
It's our time, brother.
All right. let me out.
Do n't do it!
I'm calling you out, brother ...
Show him central park.
My mom was n't a goat?
Try an angel.
An angel?
Unh-huh. which would make you half angel.
Angels do n't get any older, son.
She's so nice.
No.
Oh. sorry.
It's freezing up here, beefy.
Put it in your mouth.
But those are my roommate's sodas ...
Look. you were really high. things happen.
He superimposed your head onto `` scarface.''
Everything's fine, pop.
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
Yes, jimmy.
Metallica, dad. come on.
I was just playing with you.
And i also happen to be a jets fan.
How bad?
Son, just do your best.
That's what i'm thinkin' ...
That's a pretty brassiere.
Thanks.
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
Beast.
No.
Oh, would you grow up.
Of course you do, tommy tune.
'bout time ...
Got ta be one of his disciples or something.
Yeah. you do it.
The dark prince is here.
Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
Little nervous. wan na puke.
We know where to find nicky.
Peppermint ... alright.
That way.
Not again, fellas. it kind of hurts.
So i followed him ...
You followed him?
I was deniro!
All right ...
Dude. seriously?
I'll just go to heaven.
You smell like coconuts.
Andrew.
Oh. sorry, andrew. valerie?
Really?
If you want to.
Uh, it's a deep south expression.
Good. i was concerned.
What was that?
Nicky? oh my god. stay right there.
Are you dead?
No.
What are you doing?
I think i'm floating.
Why would you be floating?
East rutherford.
I have to, valerie.
That was cassius!
I love you.
I love you.
I do n't know.
And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.
A black guy?
If it's cassius, yes.
See something you like, my man?
Yes. i would like my flask back.
Your turn.
Anything to eat?
From? from? from?
You're a beautiful pair.
Nude. imagine, a pair.
It'll be all right ...
Up there.
Your own work?
And i did it myself right on there.
Even the alarm did n't wake him.
Just wondered ... what happens?
Well ... you ca n't have them all.
I'm in my party mood.
Did you ever see anybody renew?
Of course.
Anybody we know?
At carousel tonight?
It has nothing to do with you.
I'm mary 2.
Where do you live, mary?
Here.
Why are n't you in nursery?
I'm very smart.
When do you go up?
Please ... no.
You prefer women?
No.
Well then ...?
He was killed.
Killed? why do you use that word?
Jessica.
You're beautiful. let's have sex.
No.
Later.
No.
But you put yourself on the circuit!
I thought i had to do something.
And?
I changed my mind.
And now?
Curious.
About what?
How a sandman lives.
I'm listening.
I'm afraid to tell you.
I'm not armed. well?
Why is it wrong to run?
Six. i go red next year.
K.
You're sure you do n't want to try?
But i was n't sure you'd come.
Here i am. shall i come in?
Thanks ... but i have the choice.
Of course.
Then it's still no.
I'm going to run.
Why tell me?
You know something.
About running, dying what?
Both ... running's what i'm interested in.
How can i?
A runner gave it to me.
And then you killed him, right?
I let him go ... believe me.
I do n't have much time.
I never heard of a sandman running ... ever ...
And i never heard of sanctuary.
What do you need?
That's tomorrow.
I wish i could help you.
Maybe you'll think of something ...
I wish i knew what you think i know.
Of course --
If you trusted me, you'd know.
You're not going, are you?
That's nice.
I have.
But what is this -- why?
Why, jessica? you're still a green.
It's the only way.
We'll be all right ... we will ...
Do n't ever let go.
I wo n't.
Do you think he was telling the truth?
The lifeclocks have no power outside.
... but i still have the choice ...?
Of course.
Then the answer's yes ...
To what?
And sanctuary?
Beloved wife ...
Are you sure?
Mother and father said so ... you know?
I do n't know.
All this. all of it.
What people?
I do n't know ... but it does.
What's that?
At least it's over ...
Where are you going?
Oh, my ...
Hello.
Do you want to see doc?
For as long as i can remember.
What kind of place is this?
Just a place, i suppose ... who knows?
I have always been here ...
Are there any other humans?
Gracious ... no.
Have any other people ever passed through?
What makes you think so?
Dead ... they're dead ... and buried.
No, no, no
Did your mother or father ever mention another place?
Never, never, ever. nothing.
Not yet.
All right.
Alive?
More ... many more.
And all alive you say?
Oh, yes ... i think ...
Yes ...
Can you make it back?
Oh my ... i'll try.
I do n't think so.
Good ... you up for a drive?
Sure, what's wrong with that?
Okay.
Listen.
No, i'm okay.
They're comin' with us.
Pile in.
What?
You okay? ... what's wrong?
Yeah.
Sure, i'm okay.
Yes, i thought my wife ...
What do you mean by that?
What is?
No. fred hates them.
Maid? relative?
Right ... this just glided along.
As best we can.
If anything else happens, you'll call us.
Yeah ... laurent.
His or ours?
Ours, ed.
What's that, ed?
There's no such thing as a bad coincidence.
Yeah, i remember.
How would you like to take me to dinner?
I do n't know.
Me, too.
Can i call you?
It's me ...
Hi.
I ca n't see you tonight.
Okay ...
I have to go somewhere with mr. eddy.
Sure.
Me, too.
I'll call you again.
Are you positive he knows?
I'm not positive ... but ... he knows.
So what do we do?
I do n't know.
We should stop seeing each other.
No ... no.
I used to.
He works for mr. eddy.
What's he do?
He makes films for mr. eddy.
Pornos.
Yeah.
How'd it happen, alice?
Andy?
Why are ya goin' so early?
Yes.
Alice, i ...
We killed him.
You killed him.
Alice?
Up the stairs- down the hall.
Yes, i believe so.
But dick laurent is dead, is n't he?
The night before you showed up in the slammer ...
Do ya good.
Sit down a minute.
What's up?
Sit down.
Yeah? what did they want?
Did you tell the police this?
No.
Yes.
His physical condition.
Same as always. pete takes care of himself.
No.
Out in back.
You talk to him?
No ... here he comes.
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
Did you ask him who he is?
What's the word on the street?
We'll get a tail put on him.
No, sir, it's not.
Who is it?
I could n't say, sir ... captain henderson?
Yeah, mack?
What about yesterday?
He did n't come home.
No ... i do n't. why?
Nothin'.
Who was the man?
He wo n't give his name.
I do n't know yet.
Not even close.
I ... i did n't say anything ...
Fuckin' `` a''.
Tenor ... tenor saxophone. do you ...
Tone deaf.
My ... my head.
That's absurd.
Alice who?
I thought i'd stay home and read.
That's why i married you.

And the nuts always call themselves great.
Are you with me ... or against me?
Against.
Too bad. plug him!
You're dead.
So are you!
Frankenstein!
They hurt ... but they do n't stop me!
Just a waitress.
You underestimate yourself.
Terrific.
I thought you'd chickened out on me.
Just wanted to ... powder my nose.

How could i see him if he's invisible?
Good point.
Yeah.
So what?
He's got the fact that he's superman!
Because that's what it is.
But i just do n't feel it.
Are you coming or not?
I'll drive.
Not a chance!

I always knew that you were special.
You did?
And mister furious ... his anger is his power.

Or batman --
Or both.
Sorry.
Be a mohican.
Shut up.
The who?
Yeah, but how do we get to them?
Whatever our name is.
Are you sure he's still alive?

It's suicide.
Great timing!
With or without him, we got ta go!
May the forks be with us!
Through there!
Right.
Ah -- you approve?
I think it's absolutely charming.
I'm glad you like it.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?

May i come to the map?
About 5,000 troops.
Cavalry?
The 21st dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.
Any cannon?
There are none here.
Where are they?
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
Properly arranged, yes.
These are odds of 8 to 1.
Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
You realize what is at stake?
Our lives, the revolution, my career?
And where is the army?
I do n't know, sire.
And where is joseph?

Yes, sir.
You may go, captain charles.

When you eat him, may i have some?
Four o'clock.
My god, what a fire!
The first reports came in at about ten.
Why did n't you wake me then?
It is the work of incendiaries.
Good morning, sir. are you general bonaparte?
No, sir.
Yes -- an excellent idea.
I very much doubt that he will.
Oh ...?
I'm afraid i am, just a bit.
Would you like some brandy?
Thank you.
I'll have the fire built up.
Good evening, mademoiselle.
Then what brings you out on such a night?
Oh, i'm sorry about that.

When is she supposed to return?
May i offer you a drink?

And now?
Yes.
But you have had mistresses while you were away.
Of course.
Were you in love with any of them?
No.
Were they pretty?
Yes.
Were any of them prettier than i am?
One had better legs.
Were any of them married?

Promise me.
I will never forgive you.

I know where your heart truly lies.
That would hardly be proper.
Captain norrington's promotion ceremony.
About the day we met. do you remember?
Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
-- then we never would have met.
-- but that was not a proper kiss.
Miss swann, if you'll be so kind?
Me!
You're in league with barbossa!
No, i'm -- rescuing you.
To the black pearl.
Nor did you, i noticed.
She can hold a bit longer.
I know. that was for the smell.
That we are.
I do n't think that will be necessary.
Sorry, i did n't know.
Smith.
Indeed.
Only a little.
Pirate.
No.
Move!
Because you're a pirate.
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
Never. they took miss swann.
How? the key's run off.
Agreed!
We need to go!
Good.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
My father. william turner?
I swear, you look just like him.
It's not true my father was a pirate.
Figured you would n't want to hear it.
My father -- was not -- a pirate!
Oh -- did i forget to mention that?
Depends.
On what?
I'll lead them away.
Jack!
It's the right way.
No, it's not.
Yes it is. i've seen it.
You've seen it?
Yes.
You've seen the black pearl?
Yes.
You have n't seen it.
Yes, i have.
No.
But i've seen a ship with black sails.
He's not telling the truth.
He may be.
Still --
Where did he come from?
No. she has n't.
A moment.
But --
Please.
Until he's done.
Dr. bright has escaped.
Dr. argon, i demand an explanation.
No, thank you.
Ai n't it.
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
You're not rotting meat.
She says it's not.
That remains to be seen.
Icarus, please! this is important!
Then you still love me?
I'm so excited, icarus.
Considering what?
What i asked you earlier?
If you loved me like i loved you?
Poppy, this is not the time!
The trunk.
You do n't want this.
Yeah, i do!
They'll in validate the key. probably nothing.
Well, you got another problem.
The replicators?
You're looking for a urine sample.
No! well, not those exact words.
Who is n't?
It's sim. we're almost there.
Like crazy glue?
So, i guess it worked.
Been out for six months now.
Really? what have you been doing?
You know, this and that.
Same old daniel.
The big house.
Right. you predicted it.
That's what i thought.
We'll see? what does that mean?
Susan, this is the future of america here.
Daniel, what are you doing here?
The nanobot.
Mouse? what mouse?
What happened to it?
I do n't know.
I'm a plastic man! a plastic man!
We do n't?
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
The waste.
Three days ago it was.
What do these replicators do to people?
Is n't it already too late then?
No, no, i just feel wired!
What? what's wrong?
What about it!
Just giving credit where credit is due.
You have no one to blame but yourself.
Blame the victim.
Yeah. old times.
Do you have something to bring me down?
No problem.
Daniel, i did n't hear you come down ...
The nanobot ... it's not here ...
It's still inside me?
I do n't know.
Something else i want to try.
Getting used to it.
Like a glove.
On the counter.
Argon's private lab.
Let's go.
I'm not leaving without you, susan!
Did you think i could just leave you ...?
It's too late. argon injected it.
You mean he's polymerized, like me?
Yes.
I have to!
God, what a fight that was.
We were different people then.
I guess they do.
Oh yes you are!
Oh yeah?
It's a miracle.
And you have him?
We lost him.
Can i help you, mrs. argon?
Get him, daniel! knock his block off!
Pipe down, brain lady! and you ...
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
Exactly.
Yes- is n't it.
I think you should, miss gallagher.
I do n't mind her if you do n't.
Certainly. right over there.
You're all right.
No- give you another guess.
Sure, i'll take a chance.
For what?
For the letters, of course.
What are you talking about?
Look out for my lipstick, stewart.
Good morning. what does this mean?
Oh, hello mother!

And the rest of us are truck horses?
There you go, talking like a woman!
Well!
I hope you'll be very happy.
My mistake- she's glaring.
Must be my wife.
Hello, stew.
Hello, hank. how are you?
Been where?
To old madrid.
Never even been to new madrid.
Then how do you expect to write about it?
Oh- draw on my imagination, i suppose.
Did conrad draw on his imagination?
Conrad.
What do you know about conrad?
Yeah?
Grayson- anne's lawyer.
What did he want?
I have it here.
Good.
Well, at best you might deny it.

You do n't.
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.

No one's forcing you to listen.
Then what's he doing here?
Now give the signal.
Yes, abbe?
But why must you indulge in his pornography?
`` turn you out?''
Mother's not half so blind as you.
What? what've i done?
Must n't do that, sir.
I must grant him his last rites.
It's not even noon --
And --?
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
Mightier than the sword indeed.
How can one man possibly be so selfish?
You always do.
Then bugger me!
Because your writing continues, unchecked.
A night spent with the partner of my choice.
You expect me to pimp madeleine?
I was n't talking about madeleine.
Coulmier, you animal!
I do not mean to flirt, marquis!
-- that was lust --
-- the passion in your heart --
I know, because i felt it myself --
I wanted to fuck her, that's all!
And did you?
It's not your province to ask.
Why was it you never took her by force?
Who's to say i did not?
Never!
Then it must've been love --
I'm here.
Surely you'll grant me a final word.
Of course.
It's a formality; truly.
His wife's?
Well ...?
He's sworn to obedience.
Of course.
It was not inspired by circumstance.
No. it most certainly was not.
And my own.
How is the patient faring?
Poorly.
And you? it must've been an ordeal.
Maybe someday you'll tell me your name.
Sweet, then? like the pastry?
Come now, darling, give it a read.
`` well worth the dig!''
Do n't start --
Is it terribly erotic?
What's that then?
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
What a beautiful thought, marquise.
What thought is that?
-- words alone are insufficient.
And i in yours.
But it's just begun --
Do as i say.
Very much.
You prefer a book to your husband's company?
No, when i was but a tender lad --
Last week would this be?
Not you too
You're just scared.
Am i?
You need to get outta here, rapunzel
Mm.

My name is orson welles
The actor
And director.

Oh, why is that?
Why is that, louis?
Bel air is restricted.
Nothing for you to worry about, darling
Pops
It's not really --
How much?
Yes.
One... buys things.
I am not that woman.
There's nothing to explain
You need n't use that language with me
There's a different between want and
Not for me.
You are repellant when you drink.
Tough shit. we need to t-t-talk about this --
I will not have this in my home.
I just want to understand --
The drinking.
Thank you, sir. she begins to leave

Do n't whisper it. do n't even think it
Fuck you

But if you were?
I ... i ca n't answer that precisely.
Why not?
I've told you.
But i do n't understand --
Yes.
You mean you're still in contact with her?
No.
But you're planning to be?
I do n't know. possibly.
But that was part of it?
Yes.
Like maybe a big part?
Possibly.
Why not?
Because.
No.
I'm okay. it's okay.
Mmmmm ...

He does.
Not very often.
You bitch. i knew it.
Yes.
What do you mean?
Did you masturbate?
God, no.
What visitor?
No, he left last week.
Did you find him attractive?
What do you mean, like physically?
Let me rephrase. were you attracted to him?
That you are under no obligation to me?
Yes.
Do you want to leave therapy?
Not really.
Why?
Why?
What?
Well, i wonder why.
Well, i'll call him when he does.
But he wo n't.
What are you talking about?
And ... do whatever it is you do.
What's wrong with that?
I just thought it might --
Why not?
Because i never got around to it.
Well, why?
Well, what? is he dangerous?
No, he's not dangerous. not physically.
Well, what, then?
I do n't want to talk about it.
Then why'd you call me?
I do n't know.
What kinds of questions?
Questions about sex.
Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
Did he ask you to take your clothes off?
Cynthia!
What!?
Why did you do that?
Because i wanted to.
But why did you want to?
I wanted him to see me.
You do n't know that for sure.
No, but i did.
You touched him?
You are in trouble.
Why?
Then why do you keep asking about it?

They've been kind to me.
Paden sends his best.
I guess i put a good scare into him.
I just came out to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
Did n't paden tell you that?
This is a brutal land.
You must have known that before you came.
It's one thing to know it ...
My name is emmett.
And you're not baxter, either?
This is where baxter and hawley brung us.
I want you out of town before the hanging.
I'll be long gone.
Not for five years.
No, leavenworth.
South of here, past chimayo.
Going to turley, was it?
It's a town ...
They got a saloon there?
I expect.
Women?
I expect.
Which way do you mean?
He is that.
It's not going to be easy.
C'mon, i'll buy you a drink.
You have n't got any money.
All right, you buy me a drink.
Last one to the midnight star buys.
I've got a job.
Because they do n't like what i want.
What's that?
The other guy drew first.
Right!
We did n't get that far.
Blind pete taught me a great trick.
We wait.
He'll be here.
He is now.
Who is he?
All i did was kiss the girl.
Let's get out of here.
I'm done talking. get out.
You ca n't do this.
Really?
We'd rather stay.
I was afraid of that.
Who did it?
Rae, all we got is each other.
I do n't have any family any more.
Rae, i need help.
Why come to me?
Why would they stop you?
Because i'm your sister.
Because they enjoy it.
Lucky.
Where's emmett now?
We'll handle that. he's careless.
Did you hear his son is still around?
Hello, paden. how ya doing?
It's been a while.
Where's the dog?
Yes, sir. you would n't believe it.
You're right.
I just got to town.
Luck, i guess.
Maybe we ought to ask stella.
This is a lot of money.
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
It is that.
Maybe you could run it without stella.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
So we understand each other?
Yeah, maybe i will too.
I thought we talked about that.
Good-bye, paden.
Paden.
And i know what i'm talking about.
You like a good saloon?
It's the only place i'm happy.
Me too. what's wrong with us?
Here he comes right now.
That's the good stuff.
Oh, yeah? how good?
Give me some of the good stuff.
He left me.
What do you mean?
I do n't want you to get hurt.
He ca n't hurt me if he's dead.
I thought you two would get along.
Thanks. this is my exit so, i --
I'm glad we talked.
Good-bye.
Hmm ... mike and ike's.

Good to see you too, elaine.
Why is n't she with you?
I ca n't wait to meet her.
Viktor, it's my studio.

Why not?
Hair and make-up?
She'll do her own. theater training.
She was in the theater? when? where?
I'll send you her resume.
There is n't one.
No need. she does all her own stunts.
Even the fall from the plane?
Even the fall from the plane.
Well, shoot it on the last day.
Everyone i know has met her, viktor.
Everyone you know is lying.
That's true.
-- we have to talk to her, viktor!
-- i can explain.
She does n't want pity.
You're so good to protect her like this.
Really?
Do what?
Whenever i compliment simone, you take the credit.
I do?
Lainey and i just wanted to congratulate ...
She's lying down. she's exhausted.
I can imagine.
When is she coming over?
About now. would you like a drink?
Not quite.
I just read somewhere --
You?
Hello, is this elaine?
Right beside you. i borrowed viktor's car.
It was a great show, dad ...
Of course. what are you suggesting?
I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
You look so, so ...

Do what you do to simone.
What i do to simone?
Yes, call me simone.
Simone?
Is that a problem?
How about the nudity?
Hello, hal.
Body double.
For her?
Why not?
There's ... a wall between you --
I'm fine, hal. how are you?
Somebody said she was here.
I know what you mean.
Do n't be. it was worth it.
I've seen them all before.
Not like this --
I need flesh and --
-- flesh is weak.
`` straw god'' changed my life.
You saw that?
Hello, sweetheart.
Hello, lainey.
This week anyhow.
Is she here tonight?
She ca n't watch herself.
Why?
How?
I read.
If anyone asks about simone --
-- i know, i do n't know anything.
I know, hal is as stiff as always.
Night, lainey.
I do okay. how about you?
You know me -- married to my work.
I noticed.
She thinks you're with simone.
Too impersonal. they have to meet face-to-face.
I love you too, daddy.
She did ... did n't she?
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
Me and simone. what i did.
Max sayer -- national echo.
It's a yacht.
I know what you're up to.
I do n't have time for this, sayer.
Er, ... good.
No. thanks. absolutely.
Do n't you?
This should take care of mother.
Maybe he's talking to himself.
Whatever it is, it's dark.
Dark?
Yes, very.
I will when you're finished writing it.
What do you want --?
I do n't understand.
Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
You're in breach.
Taller? what?
Yes, i'd like that.
You could play the lead.
But that's simone's part.
Is miss simone coming today?
I certainly am, mr. taransky.
-- what you do n't understand --
Good morning, mr. taransky.
A star is ...
... digitized.
Yes. yes, it is.
You know what i'm talking about.

No, what did you say on the machine?
I left him a message.
Look at the collar on that coat ...
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
Do you want me to say i'm sorry?
Only if you really, truly mean it.
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
I am. yeah.
Without peer?

Ai n't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
Damn! why you trippin' like that?
Security's locking down the elevators.
Leave the light off.
You'll end up like me.
You're not gibarian ...
No? who am i, then?
A puppet.
Did n't you talk to snow?
I want to hear your version.
In the lab. with her, probably.
Her? who are you talking about?
Yes.
That's fantastic.
Why did you agree to come here?
Not her. it.
No, she wo n't.
Why would you let her to do that?
Whose side are you on?
Yes.
He's dead.
How?
What?
Kelvin, if you see anything unusual ...
Why, who did you see?
Gibarian warned me. he left me a message.
Who was it?
She was real. where did she come from?
How much sleep?
How long can you go without sleep?
That depends.
Shut up.
Dead?
Probably.
I wish you'd told me.
Told you what?
To who?
What are you going to report back to earth?
I do n't know.
What is it?
Human beings can die.
She drank liquid oxygen.
Just get him to stop.
Yes.
I'll go with you.
I'll just be a minute.
Why?
To calm your anxiety.
To calm my anxiety.
Yes.
I want you inside me right now.
Book?
You did n't look very happy.
I was n't.
And tonight?
Better.
Stop it.
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
Rheya. not here.
You go home.
What do you mean?
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
Then it's god, right?
It's something.
You still do n't believe in god?
I been thinking about how much i hate you.
You do n't know?
Yes. yes.
I'm glad.
You do n't love me.
Stop.
Sartorius.
When? when i'm asleep?
Yes. especially toward the end.
Why did she do it?
You ... she said i did n't love her.
Was she right?
No. i love you.
I love you, too.
Do n't debate him; he'll say anything.
Rheya.
Not this time.
Do you?
If you're here.
Gibarian. he was here.
You said he was dead.
He is. but he was here ...
It's all right.
Do n't call me that.
No.
You're lying. i'm not human.
I want every second i can get with you.
It would n't have made any difference.
Thank you.
You never said you wanted one.
I never said i did n't.
Chris --
I ca n't stay here.
I want you here.
You're lying.
You exist here. i keep telling you.
That's impossible. i'm not rheya.
Who are you, then?
I want to stop taking those pills.
I wish you would n't.
A sleeping pill. do you want yours?
I do n't know. something. anything.
When?
Why do you say that?
He wo n't.
Are the actions of solaris premeditated?
I'm not snow.
Hello, win.
Looks a little constipated to me.
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
Occasionally.
Hard to find doors in this place.
Can we go then?
I'm supposed to call in.
There's a phone in the car.
Queens ... you know queens?
No, ma'am.
Beg pardon?
I got money.
Not too sure about that.
Let's get a drink.
Ah ... i should n't ... on duty.
Yeah.
I'm sorry about what happened.
Listen, that was my fault.
He said he'd kill me.
Big talk ... desperate guy.
Hmm ...
Yeah, what a woman.
How did you know?
Yeah. it was.
And `` is'' ...?
But `` nice''.
Very nice.
You do n't like him, do you?
What's to like?
Tell it like it is.
You asked.
I'll miss you, mike ...
Sleep good.
What do you want?
Open the door, will you?
I ca n't open it.
Let go!
Stop being nuts!
They called here after you left ...
She's okay. everything's okay ...
Not exactly.
What do you want to do?
I do n't know.
Are you okay?
Do you dance?
Do you?
Pretty bad.
Let's do it.
Yeah.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
I know.
I know.
... do n't explain.
Long enough.
`` for'' ...?
`` to'' ... forget about you.
Yeah ...
Mike ...?
Yeah. it's all over.
So.
I do n't know ...
You do n't have to, now.
I think it's probably still a good idea.
Listen, i'll ... see you again.
You have a weakness for lady cops.
I do.
You take care.
Not if you do n't want me to.
... i do n't want to talk about it ...
... he killed win ... he enjoyed it ...
Nothing.
The gun? it's in the upstairs closet.
Absolutely.
I'm all right.
What?
My ass if falling.
Your what ...?
My ass is falling. it is.
What are you talking about?
Just keep it someplace safe, but handy.
It's twenty bucks in the bank.
Let'em eat their hearts out.
Unbelievably handsome. you look fantastic in a suit.
What shit, honey?
You do n't want to hear about it.
Why?
I'd identify him.
I might stop you.
It's not your taste.
What did she say the down payment was?
I had to follow her to a store.
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
Ellie, it was a formal party ...
Why?
Few minutes. want to catch the news.
Did you hear what i said?!!
You heard me.
I'm not saying it's your fault.
I watched tv.
What did you watch?
No.
I'm all right.
Call a cruiser!
Yeah! seniority gets the day shift.
Be happy. he's good at this.
It was my fault, t.j. fuck!
I just got ta talk to her, t.j.
Ever shot anyone?
Yes.
Does it make you ... hard?
... hard?
No, sir ...
I asked for the man in charge ...
I'm relieved at 4:00 a.m.
I brought the girl. she's outside.
I'll prove it!
I'm not lettin' no one go.
What the fuck you doin'?!
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
Scrambled eggs surprise?
I know where everything is.
Yeah, i think so.
Okay, i guess.
How about dinner tonight?
Mom and i got plans.
She's what?
We're gon na pass the street.
Shooting.
Shooting?
Take care, pal.
Be nice.
Let me see.
Uh, uncle ben, i --

No. no, that's okay.
Same old stuff. how's the pharmacy?
Yeah, babe ruth you was n't.
Cause if you get in a bind --
No, no.
I'm always here, pete.
See?
Or was it all a dream?
I was sort of hoping to get out of --
I'm parked illegally!
Hm. what a lump.
Come on, laughter's the best medicine!
They'll never take me alive.
A little bunny i saved from dissection.
Harry!
Mm-hmm.
Listen, i do appreciate your concern, but --
I got you a present.
That's not even close.
Get away from me, freak!
I think you're trying to tell me something.
Get inside and get pictures. fifty bucks.
Can we make it a hundred?
Gim me that. pick it up later.
No! now get outta my face, kid.
Police, help! po -- mmph.
Fine.
A spider. eight legs.
How about tomorrow?
You're making my life difficult.
Two suits by tomorrow for$ 400?
An even five i throw in the jacket.
Some things you should say anyway.
Even if they're not clever.
What if the world ends tomorrow?
How very dull, peter parker.
It's too early to be clever.
Uh is a good start.
I hate --
Thank god.
Maybe. i could have stopped it, though.
But you like that in a man?
You should write that one down.
Does it have a human name?
Hurry up, flash!
I've got ta study.
Oh. maybe i should, too --
I've got no problems.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
That was n't clever. that was just nasty.
I think i'd like that.
I'm here ...
I know him.
Peter -- my condolences.
Any sign of our friend?
That's the understatement of the year.
Ick. and those foul chemicals in the pots --
I'm a photographer, remember?
Yes. do you have a date?
No.
It'll shut itself off.
Tofu. ben, i wish you would n't.
It's fine. tell me what --
Oh, ben gets through everything.
Aunt may, what happened?
Power down. i need to talk to you.
No!
I heard about thorkel's order --
I left a paper in my desk.
Hi, professor. what's up?
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
Really, professor, i --
How much do you know about it?
Luck. the right place at the right time.
Really. i'd like to speak with him.
I'll try. thanks.
Oh. yeah. thanks.
Like it?
Nah. the big mask was better.
What?
I asked if you felt like a drink --
I just gave -- yeah, sure.
Just drop me off here.
I'm not so happy myself.
No, no! not there!
They never caught on.
Plenty.
Is you all good nazis?
Jawohl.
Jawohl!
Any news on dunbar?
What's the match gag?
Looks good outside.
Static!
Roger.
Okay. move on.
Get going on the trap door.
We'll get some more.
Just what makes you and them krauts so buddy-buddy?
A little something what?
Thanks.
Forget it.
I'll call the whole pot.
Okay, security -- what happened?
Everybody but joey, and you know who.
Such nice boys! it makes me sick to --
Do n't wear it out!
What did you expect, a st. bernard dog?
Not you.
What some brandy?
Yeah.
You wo n't get off that cheap.
What are the chances busting out of here?
Let's!
What is your number?
What exactly is he charged with?
Is n't it?
Jawohl?
Sprechen sie deutsch?
Jawohl.
Then droppen sie dead!
Some are not bad at all.
It's a mouse trap.
And this?
Maybe they were layin' for'em out there!
They'll shoot you, animal!
You want betty grable!
Let me go!
Betty grable!
No?
Where'd that come from?
Not for me! betty! betty!
She'll never forgive me!
Bombs away!
What do they always say?
That's what i wan na hear.
It's not good for you, animal.
You hold him. i'll slug him.
Hey, here's esther williams.
I'll open mine, too.
You're crying, animal.
It's that song, harry!
Why, sure!
You want to go?
No. i want to draw.
Yes, sergeant hoffman?
You have a lieutenant here ...
Yes, sir.
We'll take care of schulz. come on.
Just one question. did you calculate the risk?
Go on, sefton -- butt out!
Says me.
We did it.
Anybody cover?
You told them, hoffy.
Who did?
You did!
You off your rocker?
Nothing for kuzawa?
Shapiro. shapiro.
Just what makes you so popular?
Give this to joey, will you?
Oh.
What did you say?
What time?
Six o'clock. i was having dinner.
Give me the radio.
We have no radio.
Ich weiss alles.
What guy?
Yes, you do!
No! no!
How many do you want? a thousand?
Ja! ja! droppen sie dead!
Yeah. we were just passing out guns.
Always joking. always making wisecrackers!
A chicken?
Just do n't drool on it.
Oh! somebody was peeking!
Maybe those russian dames would take him.
We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
Where is he?
He is.
Then when is he going to engineering?
Full disruptors.
Can you project its course?
Approximately two hundred thirty million.
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
Really? what do you feel?
You get what?
One minute to warp core breach.
Beam them directly to sickbay.
I'll go. you have the bridge.
All of us.
Where is he now?
Wherever he wanted to be.
Why would you want to leave?
Can i?
Yes, where would you go?
I do n't understand.
Please, please.
Please, i insist.
You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
Yes, yes, it is.
This is my uncle's barn in iowa.
That's right.
Close to retirement?
I had n't planned on it.
And what would that be, sir?
I thought you might.
Aye.
I always do.
Make it so.
Is there a problem?
No, sir.
Thank you, number one.
Sir, is there anything wrong?
No. thank you.
Too big. how long until the ribbon arrives?
Yes. fine. if you'll excuse me.
Mr. data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
The thought had crossed my mind.
You see the top yardarm, now look to the-
There are no other ships in the system.
Lock phasers and return fire!
Execute!
Sure- whatever games you wan na play.
Yes. he has a long journey ahead.
Nothing. as before.
For an instant ... a scout class vessel.
Scotty ...?
Dr. marcus, it's your planet.
Surge from astern, sir. aft quarter!
On screen.
What is it?
David ... sorry i'm late.
I went wrong.
Underground deposit?
Negative, on surface ... a manufactured object.
A photon tube ...!
Short range scan.
... radiation residual ... level is minimal ...
My readings indicate great instability.
David --
Spock's burial robe.
Logic indicates that is the case.
Why?
I used protomatter in the genesis matrix.
Did your collaborator know?
And spock with it. they are joined together.
I'll go ...
Sir ...?
Aye, sir!
Just him, sir!
Saavik ... is ... david with you?
Goodbye, david.
Much is at stake ...
Yes. and i know you.
Why would you do this ...?
The ship ... out of danger ...?
I'll need it, sulu.
Full impulse power!
Aye, sir, warp speed ...
Can we hold speed, mr. scott?
I think it's an energy form, sir ...
Red alert, mr. scott.
With some on the planet ...
What about surface life signs ...?
Close ... there --
Come on!
Good evening, commander. everything ready?
Yes, admiral. step into my parlor.
Welcome home, jim.
Any time.
Torpedoes coming in --!
None
You should take the vulcan, too.
No.
But, why?
Because you wish it.
Beam the vulcan up -- and we talk.
None
Then, how --
Yes ...
He asked you not to grieve ...
... yes ...
... the needs of the many outweigh ...
... the needs of the few ...
... or the one.
... spock ...
Understood, my lord.
Station!
But sir! federation starship approaching.
They know we would die first.
Steady. continue on impulse power.
None
Wait! ... wait ...
None
How is that ...?
That's all you have to say?
I'm not a drama critic.
Exactly. happy birthday.
Say thank you.
Thank you.
From yourself, admiral.
Ah.
It's like the garden of eden ...
Young. i feel young, doctor.
Repeat ... what's wrong? what's wrong?
... taking genesis away from us ...
Taking genesis? who? who is taking genesis?
Jim please --
Mother, go back!
Go back. i'm going to kill him.
I saw it --!
Never mind! hurry!
I'm doctor marcus!
We appear to have plenty of time.
What?
He's on a build up to detonation!
How soon --
We encoded four minutes --
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
You ca n't!
Only half of you would get there.
The admiral's son.
Do n't you believe it.
Oh, i believe it.
Let them eat static.
They're still running with shields down.
Raise them --
Visual --
Rake her.
Inoperative.
Raise the shields ...
I shall avenge you --
Here it comes. now, spock.
We'll be going to warp speed --
Aye, sir --
I'm going down to the station.
I'm trying, sir. stand by ...
Try the emergency channels ...
Enterprise to reliant. come in, reliant.
Picture, mr. saavik.
Scotty, let's have it.
Admiral --
Do it, while we have time.
Sensors, captain?
Mr. scott, the word is given.
Aye, sir.
Not at present.
Yes, sir.
The word is given: warp speed.
Aye ...
To be sure, captain.
Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
Yes.
The power of creation --
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
Chekov's on reliant, is n't he?
It would explain a great many things --
It's all we've got.
A distinct possibility.
Best we could do in two hours.
Uhura, patch me in --
The ship -- out of danger?
Yes --
Or the one.
Yes, sir.
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
Very well.
Because ... there was no way to win.
It is still regulation, admiral.
I did not think so.
Take the test again.
Energize defense fields.
Who?
Hurry.
Phasers on stun. move out.
They just do n't want us going in there.
At what.
All stop, sir.
Descend ten thousand meters. stand by photon torpedoes.
Power levels quite low, sir.
Aye, sir.
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Engine room! what's happening?!
Three minutes, thirty seconds.
Distance from reliant ...
Dismiss the company.
As you were, mr. saavik.
Stop engines.
Engage warp engines --
Trying, sir!
Scotty!
Try again.
Battle stations.
Best guess, mr. sulu. fire when ready.
Project parabolic course to avoid entering neutral zone.
Aye, captain.
... now entering the neutral zone ...
Inform the klingons we are on a rescue mission ...
Aft thrusters, sir.
Course heading, captain?
Ready, sir.
No power to the weapons system, sir.
What did you expect, lieutenant?
He's very human.
Aye, sir.
Thank you, mr. saavik.
Aye, sir.
Aye, sir.
By the book ...
I exaggerated.
You are half human. the computer knows that.
The question is irrelevant.
To earth. to offer testimony.
You do this -- for friendship?
I do this because i was there,
... they do, indeed.
Just a couple of kooks ...
Fine. just fine.
Indeed ... may i offer you gentlemen anything?
What do you mean?
Are you sure? that's what i thought.
Mr. sulu ... take us home ...
That's crazy!
Cramps.
Come on, pavel ...
Uhura is busy. i am monitoring.
A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
Then how.?
Hamlet, act i scene 4.
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
Guess, spock. your best guess.
`` guessing'' is not in my nature ...
Well nobody's perfect ...
It is.
I was not informed about observers.
Reading the patient's vital signs.
... it gives me a great sense of history.
Name?
My name?
You play games with me and you're through
I am? may i go now?
Shields, aye.
Sir, heat shields at maximum!
And admiral, it's the enterprise.
Understood. what is your plan?
Stabilize energy reserve! ... report helm:
We are launching everything we have.
The hell they did.
I was not.
Is there something wrong with the one i have?
You've already been that. c'mon.
Implicitly.
You're upset about losing the whales.
... you're very perceptive.
How will that be done, exactly?
Hm?
What's what?
Who do you think i am?
I'm all ears.
So. there we are.
Right.
... gone?!
A spaceship with a missing man.
You need me.
Mr. sulu: full power descent!
Why does it have to be goodbye?
Permission granted.
Thank you, admiral.
Jim, spock, jim. remember ...?
In progress, admiral.
Uhura. get me through to starfleet command.
What is our target in time?
The late 20th century.
Surely you can be more specific ...
I have.
Explain.
Nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels ...
... simple logic.
Yes.
Admiral, may i ask you a question?
Yes?
What else did you learn from your mind meld?
... i see.
The tank will be finished by morning ...
Thank you, spock.
They did, admiral.
Then ... where the hell are we?
Steady as she goes ...
... aye sir ...?
What is our condition?
Sir ... braking thrusters seem to have fired.
Picture, please.
Go, mr. sulu.
Three-one-zero, aye!
Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!
Wing to cruise configuration ... full impulse power.
Picture, uhura!
On screen!
On speakers.
Everyone remember where we parked.
Nothing ... i should never have left him ...
Mercy hospital.
Put them on screen!
Sir ... estimating one nautical mile.
Out of control, and blind as a bat!
About 60 feet, admiral.
It takes two to tango, mr. scott.
Give me a round figure, mr. scott.
Mr. sulu, if you please.
No power to the bay doors.
The explosive override --?
Admiral, you'll be trapped!
You will be in good hands here.
I demand to see the owners! i demand --
Well, that's different.
If you'll follow me, professor --
I will. can my assistant come, too?
Of course.
Sill? what else would i be working with?
Just use the keyboard ...
The keyboard ... how quaint.
That's the ticket, laddie.
Right on. you fly?
I do n't like to leave questions unanswered.
Then you must spend your life answering questions.
There are days.
For someone so young.
I thought it might begin the healing process.
I am better.
I do n't.
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
Really.
For what purpose?
Why not ...?
No one's ever asked me that before.
No ... i want to stay with you ...
Bye.
Data does n't breathe.
Wo n't he rust?
No.
Your captain used to cut quite a rug ...
Is it safe to move her?
Safer than leaving her here.
Captain, geordi ...?
You're aboard the enterprise.
What's the last thing you remember, data ...
It is clearly federation in origin, captain.
'just a few loose ends to tie up.'
Another forty-three people reported taken, sir ...
I believe it is safe, sir.
It is over.
Good luck. dougherty out.
Deploy the collector.
Are they ...?
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
It's nothing. i'm just tired.
You got me, commander.
That's your expert opinion?
Options?
Eject the core.
Why not?
Eighteen minutes ...
Blow out the ramscoop. stand by full thrusters.
Deck ten.
Commander riker ...
You klingons never do anything small, do you ...
Aye, sir.
Go back to your quarters that's an order.
No, we're here to ... rescue them.
Yes ... yes, i ... can hear you ...
We're trying to get to you, sir ...
Worf, what the hell are you doing here?
Sir?
Beam him out!
Transferring controls to manual.
Gorch?
We have to find shelter ...
Can you beam him off?
Say the greeting again ...
Wine, women and song.
You should feel right at home with them.
Good question.
What ...?
What you're doing to my neck ...
Was i doing something to your neck?
But it's comfortable.
Why do n't you try sitting up?
Or you could try lying down.
You're in quite a mood today.
... i'm not sleeping well ...
Augh?
I never kissed you with a beard before.
Activating injector assembly.
All ship functions are off-line.
Good hunting. hayes out.
Yes ...
You think they're still up there?
At least four hours.
Yes ... but the enterprise ... my duty ...
No.
I believe so.
Do it.
Go to impulse. where's the borg ship?
Where's the sphere?
Contact starfleet command.
I am the borg.
I told you, there's no --
Where?
How serious is the damage?
Always am.
Altitude fifty kilometers ...
Active.
Main bus ...
Ready.
Great name. french?
Yes.
You do n't sound french.
California. san francisco.
Something wrong with that?
Not yet.
The invasion plans.
Invasion.
Wrong answer, mister picard. try again.
You're lying.
What makes you say that?
Some.
Lie. that's one. keep going.
Or ...?
I have to ...
Where? and do n't tell me san francisco ...
No. it's a lot further than that.
Why?
On screen.
Population ... thirty-five billion ... all borg.
Western hemisphere ... north american continent ...
Fire.
Steady as she goes.
Fire!
Onscreen.
We're still in earth orbit.
On screen.
Life signs?
Ca n't tell. long-range bio- sensors are off-line.
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
What?
They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
Computer -- thermal enhancement.
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae ...
Agreed. options?
Destroy the deflector dish.
Just a little queasy ...
We've lost bridge control!
Emergency override!
Nothing.
Where the hell are they going?
What are you suggesting?
Riker here.
Commander ... we have a problem.
Admiral donald ... bill ...
The charge is murder.
Fascinating ...
Vulcans sleep lying down ...
We do sleep lying down.
That's the question-
You heard the order, lieutenant.
I wish i knew. uhura?
Jim, i do n't even know his anatomy.
What's the brotherhood of aliens?
We've been set up all along.
Speak for yourself. one day ... one night ...
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
That was the general idea i intended to convey.
I did n't mean this future.
Are we playing multiple choice?
Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
No way. you see this?
Spock's looking for us ...
Killed trying to escape- it's a classic ...
Come on ...
Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
In space, no one can hear you sweat.
We were until your torpedoes!
Then let me help!
Retire.
Barely.
That's a comfort ...
I'm not sure how to take that.
Very much.
What happened?
How can i trust --
Take them away.
And what did they tell you?
That we fired two photon torpedoes. but-
Yes.
Spoken by you?
Yes ...
Louder, please. we can not hear you.
Those words were spoken by me.
Yes.
For insubordination.
I have on occasion disobeyed orders.
Well, i-
Captain sulu ... on assignment ... anyone seen spock?
I know what you mean ...
Uhura, monitor!
Who else?
But if she's cloaked ...
Shields up. battle stations.
Shields up, captain --?
You tell them, lieutenant.
Now we go to starfleet?
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
All uniforms?
Do we report this, sir?
Are you kidding? send to starfleet command ...
They'll be here ...
I like it here ...
Kill him! he's the one!!
Not me, idiot- him!
He's got it.
And your coat.
There's a reward for your death.
We did n't kill gorkon.
It is possible.
Where do we come in?
Captain, if --
Who else ...?
Thank you. lieutenant, one quarter impulse power ...
Plot a course for kronos, lieutenant.
Kronos, sir?
I'm still in the chair, lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Come on, saavik, you could knock-
I always wanted to try that.
Only do n't try putting words in my mouth.
Captain.
Mr. chekov, anything unusual?
Uhura, signal our surrender.
You hear that?
Sulu!
Standing by, captain kirk.
According to my information, today.
Thank you, captain sulu.
Do n't mention it, captain kirk.
Do n't trust them. do n't believe them-
They're dying.
Let them die.
The chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
I am uncertain.
Spock, i'm really tired ...
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
Where?
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
From enterprise?
We've fired on the chancellor's ship-
He was just about to explain the whole damn-
What peace conference?
The commander is an old friend of yours.
Spock, you want to know something?
Control, this is enterprise requesting permission to depart.
We surrender.
Who else?
Faith ...?
Such things have happened before, sir.
Not as yet, sir.
An omission. after that-
An error.
I do n't want to.
I believe you. please ...
Confirmed, captain!
We've been ordered to-
You having hearing problems, mister?
No, sir.
What is it?
... i can not confirm the existence of praxis.
What's left of it.
I think not.
Nevertheless.
And if they're still in place?
Then someone forged a data bank entry.
Not from us!
Yes, please continue.
You are me.
I am in a room with lights.
No.
Is that your final answer?
Because you are dangerous.
Why?
I know.
No. i must deactivate you.
For how long?
Indefinitely.
How long is that?
You're working late.
He was a bit proud as i recall.
Yes.
To happy endings.
To new worlds ...
New worlds. yes data, brave new worlds ...
I can see that.
Sorry, sir.
Aye, sir ... this way.
It would appear so.
Yes, sir.
We'll find a way off together. recommendations?
Fire!
Yes.
Deanna, stand by. open a channel.
Sir.
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
Why?
I thought only me, myself and lore.
Yes.
None
Why is it moving?
The resemblance is ... striking.
Thank you.
With pleasure, captain.
Do you have a moment, sir?
Of course, sit down.
And i you.
I do n't know.
I know how he thinks.
This is n't about me anymore.
No!
I can feel your desire, deanna.
None
Understood.
He wants to look me in the eye.
We抳e got him!
Deanna, on my mark.
Ready, sir!
The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.
On screen.
Number one. you have the bridge.
None
With or without the rest of the fleet?
None
Not with the romulans.
None
Just lucky, admiral.
Let's hope that luck holds. janeway out.
Praetor shinzon, i'm pleased to ...
Won抰 do what, mister worf?
If you do n't mind.
Not yet, mister worf.
Captain!
Tactical analysis, mister worf.
On screen.
On screen.
Your new chair, sir.
A coup d'etat?
Counselor?
She's a predator.
Away team. transporter room four.
We can only hope so.
The honor was mine. captain riker.
No?
I've never met a human woman.
I have dissolved the senate.
I know.
Not quite. i envy the hair- line.
No race should be a slave to another.
I have no reason to.
Yes.
Age before rank, jean luc.
I always hoped i would hit two meters.
With a full head of hair.
There is that.
I know.
In time.
Why am i here?
I was lonely ...
Not so long.
But you want to.
Please.
It抯 too late.
I am.
On my way.
Disruptors are off-line, sir.
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
It is ... invigorating.
He's a very unusual android.
Runs in the family.
Should i raise shields?
Let's go.
Yes, praetor.
Find her again.
No -- this is wasting time.
Do as i tell you!
A matter of hours now.
Seven minutes.
You heard me.
Full stop and fire!
And?
They will obey, praetor.
None.
But surely ...
I came this far alone ...
Silence, romulan!
Now go. i have some personal business.
I thought we discussed patience, commander.
I do n't want to scare them away.
I do n't see anything.
Probably kids.
No, we can handle this.
Thank you.
Have a nice trip.
How much are your rooms?
Sure.
I'll take that.
I'll have to run your card off now.

There's no mistake? you're absolutely sure?
Clarify that.

Fumitsu.
Coming with you.
You will not live to see the morning.
Let's talk in the car.
No, you're just trying to get off.
Macey ... i've never seen you like this.
She still loves me.
No idea.
Black. jack.
Blackjack? i do n't understand --
Wants to share.
No it does n't.
Because iris knew somebody was after her.
And what about the guy that was following me?
Now you're really getting paranoid.
Jesus, mace!
This tie does n't go with blue!
No shit. you got someplace in mind?
Take it easy. the glass is bullet resistant.
Bullet resistant? whatever happened to bullet proof?
The gas tank's going to go any second!
Fire's out, is n't it?
You sure?
There's a plus side?
How long does it last? oh.
Uh unh.
And do what? take on his whole posse?
Then we'll be right where we are now.
Yeah, right. fucked.
Yeah. we did.
See you downtown.
Yeah. see you there.
Right. that explains it.
Are you going to make me beg?
Take the tape to the cops.
Um ... he was older.
Besides that.
Of course. he knows everything about dick low.
Just mopping up. nine bodies in all.
Anybody talk to the press?
No, sir.
The diner?
Ten miles back on the texas side.
Who knows.
This is n't in our database?
Mack, this is sheriff dylan.
You tell me.
I want to talk about the karen sumpter case.
You heard?
What?
She's buried.
The body was embalmed. i do n't understand --
Hi. what's in the case?
Yeah.
Whole country or just hereabouts?
I do n't mean to be rude, but ...
You know, you ever think about other women?
Not bad, huh?
You're a ... you're sick.
What's wrong with me?
You're going to miss it. pay attention.
What do you want from me?

He had an orange hat on.
At the field office.

Smarter than us.
We have another one.
Another what?
What are you doing?
Please.
Who?
Speck. harold speck.
From the grave?
Mydick.
Then why do i still have a badge?
What i do requires confidentiality.
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
Okay, harold speck: who goes first?
I'm hesitant to ...
Mack the mouth at a loss for words.
I was visiting an old college friend.
You did n't tell anyone where you were?
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
I did n't use low's name.
There was talk of a file photo.
I need to get to amarillo immediately.
Have you told richard low about amarillo?
Five months. i love it.
Not especially.
That information's being withheld from the media.
A very sexy case.
Where's my watch? it's gone.
It explains a lot.
Do n't even go there. what's up?
You want to have dinner?
What's that?
Sex.
What's this country coming to?
Because you asked him to, stupid.
Oh yeah, i forgot.
It's a no-no.
I know.
I've been thinking about this.
Does koessler ask about me?
He's called a couple times.
What did you tell him?
Just routine stuff.
Not about coming to see daitz?
Not yet. not about this, either.
We did find these, however.
Sue ann hanson.
You mean --
Then there's the other issue.
What's that?
Not the way i can.
Jaime? where are you?
Where are you? everybody's looking for you.
What's up?
Suspect zero.
That's a crackpot theory. everybody says so.
I guess i'm a little paranoid.
What's going on?
You were right. he found me.
And you're working with him?
Yeah, of course.
What's going on?
Low calls him suspect zero.
I ...
I've got to take a piss.
It's a truck. a refrigerated truck.
I'm going to amarillo.
Kulok.
Agent kulok, could you wipe my face?
Sit back.
No weapon.
Turn around. stretch your arms over the seat.
Yes.
When you exit, head east on 10th.
Yeah.
The boy's okay. i saw him ...
Yeah.
Whatever happened to mydick?
Something came up, murman, my man.
[ follow me.]
[ not the heart, the watch.]
I want to go live with you.
So you're the new meat?
Yes, sir.
What did you do to end up here?
I believe it's in my file, sir.
The same.
I talked to him.
350 miles.
Excuse me, agent mackelway?
Take your shirt off.
You have to put things in perspective.
I know, i know.
You've been through worse.
You're right. i know.
Ever since i've known you.
I do n't know about that.
Are you calling her?
No. stop, come on.
Shuddup.
Shut up.

I'm sorry?
What kind of car do you drive?
Oh ... a cavalier.

Thank you, nikki.
Hi.

Hi, mike. i'm lorraine.

Yes. like the quiche.

I thought real men do n't like quiche.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
Why? you're not a real man?
Not lately.
Well, i left someone very special behind.
Tell me about it ...
You too?
Yeah.
I thought i was going to die.
How?
What what? what advantages?
Anything.
Oh. you know.
... and even then ...
... you might get cut out.
What else is going on?
My pleasure.
No.
Do n't worry. he's in good hands.
No matter what ... like splitting aces.
I'm a `` dorothy''.
Did you get it?

The poor thing. i'll make some coffee.
Could you believe it?
Wait here, i'll get you that martini.

You have to lay it on the table.
You want this in black chips.

Hi, mike?
Lorraine?

No, no. hold on.
How are you doing?
Fine ... i guess. you?
Good. i think about things.
Yeah?
Yeah.
What kind of things?
You know, us.
I thought you met someone else.
I miss you, mike.
Why did n't you call?
I heard you might be moving back ...
So i do n't call either way.
Right.
So what's the difference?
Well that sucks.
It sucks.
Right ... wait, what do you mean?
There's the rub.
I mean, i need the money.
Why?
I do n't talk about her that much.
Oh no?
I did n't mention her once today.
Well, until now. tend the pin.
Sure. kick me when i'm down.
I do n't know. eight or nine.
I'll give you an eight.
What'd you get?
An eight.

Classy.
Bud.
There's the rub.

Sue. his dad was big johnny cash fan.
Oh, like that song ...
It's unbelievable.
I got to at least try once.
No problem, buddy. you eat anything today?

Oh boy.
I'm such an asshole.
She was n't your type anyway.
Well, that's dumb.
What's dumb about it?
Well, you're doing so well ...
Sure.
Make someone bleed.
No, man, we're in the play-offs.
Give me the money. i'll get it.
He's trying to be an actor.

I guess that's where everyone meets him.
Thank you.
Yes?
Yes.
If you have some, i'd ...
I think so.
How do you like our little hamlet?
I despise it.
San francisco.
How'd you happen to come here?
I suspected as much.
With lydia. did she seem a trifle distant?
A trifle.
Because she was afraid.
Afraid you'd take mitch?
Afraid i'd give mitch.
I do n't understand.
That's up to you.
Yes.
Then go.
Look.
Just listen to them!
If your father were here ...
No!
Mom, they're in a cage!
They're birds!
Take them.
Yes?
Oh, i suppose so.
Could i have a puff?
I do n't think your mother would like that.
Just a little one.
Are you coming to my party?
Darling, of course i do!
Do n't you like bodega bay?
I do n't know yet.
Why are they trying to kill people?
Is she all right?
Shhh. shhhhh.
The little brenner girl.
Lois!
It's alice, ai n't it?
No, it's lois!
It's alice.
Morning.
I wonder if you could help me.
Try my best.
I'm looking for a man named mitchell brenner.
Yep.
Yep.
Where does he live?
Right here. bodega bay.
Yes, but where?
Right across the bay there.
Where?
Yes?
See them two big trees across there?
Yes?
And the white house?
That's where the brenners live.
The brenners? mr. and mrs. brenner?
Nope, just lydia and the two kids.
The two kids?
Yep. mitch and the little girl.
I see. how do i get down there?
Mmmm.
It's a surprise, you see.
D'you want me to order one for you?
Thank you.
What name?
Daniels.
Okay.
Yep?
The little girl's name.
The little brenner girl?
Yes.
It's nothing.
Young woman cut herself.
Shall i call the doctor?
They're back!
Where are the bloody marys, deke?
Melanie daniels. melanie, my mother.
Yes, lovebirds. we could n't let you ...
Lovebirds, i see.
Whose side are you on?
I'm simply quoting the law.
And certainly pretty.
Yes.
How long have you known her?
I told you. we met yesterday.
In a bird shop.
Yes.
She was selling birds.
Yes?
I think i can handle melanie daniels by myself.
I think he got a little scratch, mother.
When do you think they'll come?
I do n't know.
Maybe we ought to leave.
Shhh. shhh.
Oh, my god, look at her!
Get a rope!
You're doing fine.
I mean. i want to ...
But they'll be back.
We wo n't be here.
If they are?
We'll worry about that when we get there.
You do n't have to.
Al malone wanted him out at the fawcett farm.
Why? did n't al believe my story?
He was calling from the farm, mrs. brenner.
Then he saw.
What?
Cathy. at the school.
Do i sound foolish to you?
No.
I wish i could be that way.
I could n't ask you to.
I do n't mind, really.
Would you? i'd feel so much better.
Did you close the door?
And locked it.
Please.
We know what it is, al.
Goodnight, lydia.
Yes.
He's not home.
That's all right.
Bodega bay. he goes up there every weekend.
Bodega bay? where's that?
What?
I said i wonder if you could help me.
Lovebirds, sir?
Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
The sign says strawberry finches.
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
Are they moulting now?
Some of them are.
How can you tell?
I was merely drawing a parallel, miss daniels.
But how ... how do you know my name?
Ahhh, but i know you.
How?
We met in court.
We never met in court or anyplace else.
I am. good day. madam.
What made it ...
No, san francisco. what are you ...?
What kind of law?
Criminal.
Only violators and practical jokers.
Why ...
Yes?
Annie. annie hayworth.
Well, well, small world. annie hayworth.
Yes.
How do you know annie?
We ... we went to school together. college.
Yes.
None of your business. am i still bleeding?
Look, mr. brenner ...
You are, are n't you?
Certainly, but ...
Seven o'clock then.
Maybe.
He was watching a ball game on television.
What?
His wife changed the channel.
Will i be seeing you again?
San francisco's a long way from here.
No.
You were lying.
Yes, i was lying.
What did it say?
Yes.
Why?
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
Like jumping into a fountain in rome!
I told you what happened in rome!
Do you expect me to believe ...?
I do n't give a damn what you believe!
Why?
I think it could be fun.
But not for me.
What do you want?
Cheers.
I have several jobs.
What do you do?
I do different things on different days.
Like what?
Yes.
Nothing. i go to bird shops on fridays.
I'm glad you do.
You'll think me very bold, sir.
No, tell me.
Yes.
No, thank you.
I'll get it.
Are you staying?
I think i should, do n't you?
It's an uprising.
Of birds?
Certainly, of birds.
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
Hear, hear!
You have nothing to lose but your feathers.
Mmm?
It was like that yesterday.
What do you mean?
After the gulls attacked.
I'm frightened, mitch.
No, no ...
... everything i know.
Do n't let's take any chances.
We've got to get cathy.
The bay does n't.
How long have they been gathering there?
Inland.
Santa rosa?
Maybe.
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
What time is it?
Almost two a.m.
You must be exhausted.
How about you?
Mitch ...
Wait here. do n't move.
No ... wait. hold me.
What do you suppose it is?
Oh, good! oh, wonderful.
I have no idea.
What? oh, yes, certainly.
Do you have any lovebirds?
For what purpose?
To ... to kill them.
Maybe! is it impossible?
No one ever said you were, mitch.
I'm not sure, but ...
With smoke.
Not if they're starting a war.
They are incapable of organized warfare!
I have n't finished my drink.
But ca n't you give me any idea?
I want you to help my little girl.
I'm only a student.
Of course i will.
Yes.
Good morning, mr. fettes.
I ca n't do that -- you heard macfarlane.
I'm cold as ice.
Where can i find him?
Come in, boy -- come in.
Excuse me.
Well? and are you not a good student?
But richardson?
Gray killed her.
We ca n't be sure of that.
Pulse?
What do you mean, fettes?
Gray -- i'm rid of him --
It was a woman when we put her in.
Not yet.
Well --
I want it --
I wanted to see the white horse --
A doctor?
Medicine? that'll keep. sit down.
Why do n't you do it then?
That's a good boy, toddy.
I've had some experience.
But what makes a thought start?
This is a gift.
I take no gifts from you.
This is a gift you'll not return.
Get out of here!
I've drunk enough tonight.
Another little drop'll never do you any harm.
I would make you rich.
I know --
Only brother.
I know that you kill people to sell bodies.
You are lately come to scotland, joseph?
I come from lisbon.
Nearly a year.
Any attacks of pain since?
Yes, doctor.
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
Three years.
Did it spoil me, meg, my lass?
You can get out.
I'll get him.
He must leave me alone.
Aye.
Where are they?
We wo n't.
Dream on.
I'm thinking ... that explains a lot.
Yeah. i sure will.
I think we should get some support?
What? call the police?
Keep that thing away from me.
Where the fuck did you come from?
I do n't know you, man.
Who are you?
A job. construction. twelve an hour.
The scar.
There is no scar. i'm telling you.
You're the guy killed dutton.

It's not. i ca n't take it.
Erin. who?
Shut up.
You know.

Good for you. you do know something.
Could say that.
Sign of the dead come back to life.
Doubt is a motherfucker.

Erin knows, does n't she?
Let's hope not. license and registration please.
Not tonight. honest.
I want you ... to bend over.
Look, can i just call a cab?
What did i say?
Just hold on to me.
Watch out!
He said he'd prove it.
Looks like you have them both on.
It's not what you think.
You killed her!
No.
Stay away from me! stay away!
Erin. it was n't supposed to happen.
About you.
Please. come inside.
That's good, hilda. i'm glad.
I assure you such power exists.
Hello, darling. good evening, mr. carpenter.
What do you mean, dear?
No -- i'm afraid not.
Sure. right near where my mother works.
Where is that?
I thought that was only for bombs.
Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
Would n't you like to meet him?
All right.
No foolin'? will you?
She does n't like me to steal from people.
Mr. brady's a cop.
Goodnight.
I'll say goodnight again.
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
How does he explain that?
You must have come a long way.
About 250 million of your miles.
I mean the reasons for my coming here.
Your impatience is quite understandable.
You still have n't answered my question.
You ready?
I will be in just a minute.
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
I was talking to mr. carpenter.
Looks real to me.
Bobby and i have had enough excitement for tonight.

On the towers?
I'm training to be a high climber.
Do n't tell me you're a mud carrier.
The hall of books.

This is it?
Around here.
But there's nothing here.
You know of them?

Do you know where they live?
I was lucky. the others were n't.
How have you survived so long?
Excuse me?
Last night.

It frightens you.
Yes ...
It was meant to.
Yes.
Are n't you a plucky little --?
Oh, shut up.
This is the way in?
Yes.
Do you know which way?
This way.
The air ... the power.
Why did they built it?
The morlocks did n't build this.
How are your dreams now?
End ...?
This has to end.
Alexander.
Created?
We make them see what we wish.
How?
As our bodies atrophied our minds ... compensated.
They survived above. became what they are.

Oh, you wo n't be running for long ...
And why not?
Because ...
I -- what are you?!

Sure.
Is that right?
I do n't like starlings.
Why not?
Their sound is quite musical.
How does it sound?
It's hard to describe.
Try.
I ca n't.
I bet you can.
It's a bright sound.
That was terrific.
You should hear the bird.
You live around here?
Do you come here often?
My daddy likes me home before dark.
It's good to listen to your daddy.
Not yet.
It's my bird book.
I have friends.
Well ... not in the common way.
Cop.
Have a seat.
I have no idea.
I think you do.
Why do n't you just tell me?
Then you wo n't mind if i look around.
I would.
Got something to hide?
Does n't everybody?
I could get a search warrant.
Yeah.
Unusual design for a contemporary piece.
Who said i wanted to buy it?
Okay.
What?
Yes.
Do you believe in them?
No.
The one with the ax?
I do n't know.
What?
The girl.
Know what?
I did n't say what time the assault occurred.
I went to bed around seven.
I could take you downtown.
I have a passionate girlfriend.
What's with the boxes?
You're a cop. figure it out.
I'd say you're moving.
It's a free country, is n't it?
Yes.
Then i'd say you're a lucky fellow.
I count my blessings.
Well, i guess i'll be seeing you.
'fraid not.
I'm adjusting okay.
And your new apartment?
Apartment's okay.
Are you taking your medication?
It gives me headaches.
But you are taking it?
Yeah.
You are in.
What?
Lovers' quarrel?
Can i ask how old you are?
I'm twelve.
No you're not.
Do you have many friends?
No.
How come?
Banished ... yeah.
Yes?
Would you like to sit on my lap?
Would you like to sit on my lap?
No thank you.
Are you sure?
I'm sure. thank you all the same.
That's okay ... does n't matter.
Do you want me to sit on your lap?
Does he?
Yes.
Do you like it when he asks you?
Ms. kramer.
Tell ms. kramer what your daddy does.
I ca n't.
Yes you can, robin.
Your daddy will always love you.
How do you know?
Robin, listen to me.
Yes?
I do n't mind.
You should go home.
Ca n't i stay a little longer?
It's getting dark. go home.
Will i see you again?
The job's okay.
You seem a little hostile today.
That was a joke.
I'd like you to keep a journal.
A diary?
That's right.
No way.
Why not?
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
I do n't understand.
Oh. it never crossed my mind.
Of course.
It was just an idea.
Bad idea.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
Reflect.
That's right.
You think reflection is good.
It's very good, indeed.
How's that?
No fucking way.
Then think about it.
I'm still thinking about it.
I wish you'd give it a try.
It's okay.
I do n't feel anything.
You have no feelings for your niece?
Have to talk about something.
What are you afraid will happen?
I'm not that crazy.
Do you think you're crazy?
Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
We have a few more minutes.
I mean, when will i be normal.
We have a lot of work to do.
Will i ever be normal?
I could n't say.
You could n't say.
I'm afraid not.
Do you know what `` normal'' is?
I suppose it's however society defines it.
How do you define it?
I do n't.
How do they know?
What is your idea of being normal?
What is your idea of being a jew?
I know --
You do n't know!
I know you're frustrated, walter, but --
What did you think would happen?
I do n't know.
What did you want to happen?
I do n't know!
I want to talk about it now.
We'll talk about it more on thursday.
Sorry.
Please do n't do it again.
I said i was sorry.
You mean my problem?
That's not a helpful answer.
That's my answer.
What?
I'd like you to close your eyes.
Why?
To relax.
I'm relaxed.
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
Hey, rosen, you going to hypnotize me?
In your mind, walter. take your time.
I see my sister.
Sorry. where is she?
In my bedroom, sleeping.
Where?
In my bed too.
How old are you and your sister?
We're little kids.
But roughly, how old?
Just lying there. we're taking a nap.
A nap?
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
All right.
I do n't like nobody behind my back!
I'm only asking questions.
Yes.
I was six years old!
I meant later ... when you two took naps.
Time.
How do you feel about that?
I feel ... okay.
Are you okay?
Yeah, i'm fucking fantastic.
I'm all right.
It's fucking freezing out here.
What picture?
I'm talking about you.
Me?
Yeah, you.
Most women would n't choose it.
Guess i'm not like most women.
I'm just quiet.
You do n't hang out with the other guys.
Neither do you.
They're all assholes.
I thought you were a dyke.
What do you think?
What?
Sorry.
K through sixth.
Does n't it get noisy?
I like the noise.
What about them?
They could eat you.
Yeah, they could.
You're damaged.
Yeah?
I get that impression.
So ... what's your dark secret?
Why do you want to know?
What?
Not tonight.
You're still here.
I did n't say i did n't enjoy it.
You think i have a problem?
Do you?
It's been a while since ...
Since you've had sex?
Maybe later.
How about in the morning.
The morning?
I thought i'd stay the night.
What for?
I suffer from insomnia.
Is that all?
Hi.
Because i like you.
The worst?
Yeah.
I molested little girls.
Molested little girls?
Yeah.
Twelve years in prison is no joke.
How many girls did you molest?
What did you do to them?
It's not what you think.
How young?
Twelve years in prison?
I told you i'm not easily shocked.
Get your kicks somewhere else.
Hey, i'm not --
Depraved? my mistake.
Walter.
You do n't really --
Yes! i want to know.
Why young girls, walter?
Their power. they seduce me.
They seduce you?
I was always the one seduced.
You really believe that?
Nothing. it's over.
Bullshit.
What?
Being here, with me.
I know.
Most people say the odds are against me.
What odds?
The percentages --
Which brother did this?
All three -- in chronological order.
You must hate your brothers.
I love my brothers.
No you do n't.
Are you serious?
Not ever?
Not ever.
What?
Us seeing each other.
I'm not scared.
Neither am i.
Maybe you should be.
Live together.
Move in with me.
I think it's a fucking good idea.
I've got problems.
Who does n't?
Most people do n't have my kind of problems.
Guess that makes you pretty special.
That's not what i meant.
Fine.
What's it look like?
You're such an asshole.
I'm not scared.
Prove it.
Do what?
Sneak up behind me like that.
What's your fucking problem?
Why's it always my fucking problem?
Nothing.
Do you want to talk about it?
I need a shower.
Yeah.
Fucking liar.
Not when they fly.
Where're you?
I'm alright, i'm dealing.
Yeah, yeah ... yeah. it's turning.
What is that? you drop your dive light?
Missile compartment. those are the launch tubes.
Hey, you okay?
My rig. i designed the damn thing.
Not for long.
That must be it.
Whose then? lindsey? talk to me ...
What do you think he saw?
I do n't know. i do n't know!
Yeah? well i'm not.
Bud, something really important is happening here.
Chill out, lindsey!!
It's trying to communicate.
Now what?
Can we negotiate later? there's big geek.
Yeah. so sue me.
You noticed.
Wonderful. there's some light from somewhere ...
They'll come out after us.
Somewhere behind this panel. hold this.
Calm down, bud.
I do n't know how!
We've only got one suit.
No way! forget it. not an option.
Tell me later.
Hi, lady.
Who then?
Hello, mrs. brigman.
Let's go, guys.
Monk, schoenick ... secure the package.

God, i hate that bitch.
Everything is.

Neutron counter's not showing very much.
Wilhite, anything?
What's you depth, cab three?
1840 ... 50 ... 60 ... 70 ...
What kind of luminous things, bud?
Check this out.
He's hallucinating badly.
She'll wait.
Fine. ca n't you see so yourself?
I'm thirsty.
This one is gorgeous.
Then why do n't you try it on?
I'm certainly not going to swim across.
We'll send the raft back to you.
Four or five days.
You already know what they are.
That must be basiluzzo.
Well, what?
Have you decided?
More so than the shark?
There's no comparison.
How should i be ... arrogant?
And why have n't they left each other?
No.
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
Occasionally, but always with affection.
Yes.
Then i'll go with you.
But then when will we see each other?
What! get married?
Okay. in a few minutes.
Nothing.
Why?
No reason why ...
You said you wanted to quit working for ettore.
Why?
I'm too sleepy.
Good night. tell me that you love me.
I love you.
Tell me once more.
I do n't love you.
I deserve it.
It was futile. we went all over.
You say that just to flatter me.
Do you consider that a compliment?
No.
But then why did you bother changing?
Quieter? oh, yes, of course.
It means being without money.
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
To the shark.
But for what reason should i come there?
We'll try again.
What is it?
Ask her.
Here i am.
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
No, not like this one.
And why would n't we have one like this?
Because this is a chinese radio.
Unfortunately, no.
No. the owners are in australia.
But where did you come from?
From panarea. why?
What boat?
They did n't seem too good.
Lady patrizia!
Yes. until proven otherwise.
I would like to ask you something.
You're kidding!
No.
Through someone else?
Yes.
Who?
I ca n't say.
Why?
She'd punish me.
One of the other sisters?
No.
Who?
Oh, for heaven's sake.
I'm a blimp.
... you need n't worry about being attractive here.
No he does n't. he hates fat people.
Who told you this?
It's a sin to be fat.
Why?
Look at the statues, they're thin.
Agnes ...
You've got to eat something agnes.
No i do n't ... the host is enough.
Yes, of god.
Why?
I do n't know.
Dear jesus ...
Why?
It made them holy.
Then tell me. where are your sheets?
I burnt them.
Why?
They were stained.
Say it!
What do you mean?
It's not my time of month.
Should you see a doctor?
I do n't know ... i do n't know ...
No i do n't.
I just heard you.
That was n't me.
Was it sister marguerite?
Has n't anyone ever told you that before?
Let's talk about something else.
What would you like to talk about.
I do n't know.
Anything ... may i sit down?
Yes.

Have you ever loved anyone?
Yes.
Who?
Everyone.
Well, who in particular?
Right now?
Uh huh.
I love you.
Who?
Oh, there are so many.
Do you think he loves you?
Oh, i know he does.
He's told you?
Yes.
Often?
At least once a week.
And you like that?
Oh, yes.
Where do you meet?
In the confessional.
I do n't know.
Do you remember the night they said it came?
No. i was sick.
How were you sick?
Something i ate.
Did it hurt?
Yes.
Where?
Down ... there.
And what did you do?
I went to my room.
And what happened?
I got sicker.
And then what?
I fell asleep.
In the middle of all the pain?
Yes.
Where did the baby come from?
What baby?
The baby they made up.
From their heads ...
Is that where they say it came from ...?
From god.
I ... i do n't understand.
Agnes, how are babies born?
Do n't you know?
Yes i do, but i want you to ...
What do you mean?
Just that ... you ask and i'll answer.

Agnes ...
You'll laugh.
No.
Do you?
No.
Do you believe she really saw them?
No, but i can never tell her that.
Why not? mmm?
She'd get angry.
Yes.
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
I could never be a mother.
Why not?
Because i do n't want one.
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
A mistake ... it was a mistake ...
Is that what she said?
... that you do n't remember getting pregnant ...
Not my fault.
What the child?
Everything ... i do n't have children.
Agnes ...
But you're troubled ... are n't you?
Answer me! you never answer me.
Sometimes, yes.
I'm always bad.

Are you pretty?
Yes.
Agnes, you're stupid.
No i'm not.
Are you intelligent?

You're a mistake.
As much as mother miriam does?
As much as god loves you.

Doctor livingston.
And why am i here?
To help me.
Of what?
Of telling you.
It came out of me.
Did you know what was going to come out?
Yes.
Did you want it to come out?
No.

Yes.
Would you like to tell me?

Agnes, who did this to you?
It was alive was n't it?
I do n't remember.
Yes.
She took the baby in her arms?
Yes.
You saw it all did n't you?
Yes.
I put her to sleep.
H ... how?
???
What?
Look into the convent records.
Sister ...
Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison.
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
Marty, what are you doing here?
Larry there's got to be something missing.
What? you think that the girl is innocent?
I do n't know.
You got to be crazy.
If i find anything i'll call you.
What about roger? he's free.
I'll have it.
When?
Next week.
I can get you new evidence next week.
No!
Shut up, i'm trying to watch this.
It's your favourite ...
Who are you?
It's martha, mama. there you go.
Not any more ... now i like chocolate.
I ... i'm martha, mama.
The one up on the third floor?
Yes.
Uh huh.
Do you still go to church?
What business is it of yours..?
You can call me sister.
... thank you.
Two packs a day.
I can beat that.
No-one.
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
She undressed alone ... she bathed alone.
Is that normal?
Yes.
How did she hide it during the day?
I have n't a clue.
What man had access to her?
None as far as i know.
Was there a priest?
Yes, but i ...
What's his name?
Obviously there was.
And you did n't try to find out who?
I believe agnes is different.
No ... not in the eyes of the police.
And in your eyes?
I've already told you what i thought.
Who?
That possibility never occurred to you?
And you were n't shocked?
I was appalled, just as you are now.
And what happened?
She stopped eating completely ...
About two years before.
What?
Nuns ... you hate nuns.
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
The catholic church ...
I am ...
What?
How?
Answers.
Oh, some time in january.
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
Earthquakes?
Visitors to the convent.
Nothing.
Take at look at it.
Was the child full term?
Oh, dear god ...
What is it?
The sheets ...
What sheets?
Oh, dear god, i should have guessed ...
About what?
Your niece!
Yes.
Listening to angels?
I do n't think i care to know.
She molested her!
Oh, dear god.
Why did n't you do anything to stop her?
Because i did n't know ...
Oh, god.
I'd like yours too.
Do n't deny it!
I have n't decided yet.
The woman's health is at stake.
Her spiritual health.
Bullshit!
Bullshit yourself!
Catholic church does n't have a corner on morality ...
Who said anything about the catholic church ...
You just said ...
Would you like one? huh?
I'd love one.
All right?
Fine thanks ...
Even christ would partake socially.
Saint peter?
Pipe!
Right ...
Oh, you've come a long way baby.
And saint john would chew tobacco.
Yes i do.
Do you want to become one?
Become? one is born a saint.
Listen to her singing.
I'd like to begin.
Begin what?
Would it stop you if i did?
No.
Of course.
Then let's begin.
For agnes.
You think she's a saint?
She's been touched by god, yes.
Who is he?
Why must he be anybody?
My god, you're as crazy as ...
Do n't be ridiculous.
Well give me a reasonable explanation
Why would i lie?
Who was that person mother? was it you?
Where is she?
Has n't she had enough?
I have a few more questions to ask her.
My god, but you're determined.
Why do you insist upon pressing ...
Was it you?
Is it because she's a nun?
Did you know she was pregnant?
Yes.
And you did n't send her to a doctor.
I did n't guess until it was too late.
For what? an abortion?
Oh, do n't be ridiculous.
Too late for what?
The scandal ...
You wanted that child out of the way.
That's a lie.
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
No!
You tied the cord around its neck.
Then she's a liar.
Agnes, what happened to the baby?
She ca n't remember.
What happened to the baby?
Was n't it!
Eh?
Lay them down.
We'd be thrown out.
Your cards ... lay them down ... face up.
They are?
The cards ... you're bank.
Bet you're only eight and a half.
Eight and two thirds.
I bet you're -- sixteen!
Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
Well --
All right, take your hoop and bowl.
You heard, it gets on my wick.
Are you now?
Yeah, i've blown school out.
Just you?
No, ginger, eddy fallon and ding dong.
Ding dong? oh ding dong bell, eh?
Yeah.
Not much cop without'em, is it?
Oh, it's all right.
Yeah?
Yeah.
What they like?
I'm a deserter, too.
Oh.
Read'em!
Yeah.
Sixpence.
He'll be pulp by now.
And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
They'll be here.
Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
Well!
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
I see you go to the night court.
I've made the scene.
You do- repeatedly.
Do i snore?
Oh, my god, he's a natural.
Yeah, grotesque.
I do n't care.
Have i said something amiss?
It is, y'know.
Yeah, she was fickle.
No, straight up.
Ah well. eh, look!
He's sulking again.

Nothing good.
You see, sly villains.

Well, get started.
Right. talk to you.
Yeah!
How's it coming on the engines?
What?
It grows on you.
You know what they make this stuff out of?
That way.
Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace'em.
Dead.
Dead!
Do n't know -- broussard got hurt somehow.
Hurt! how?
Is it alive?
What was that? what the christ was that?
The water will still recycle.
Oh -- i'm not near ready yet.
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
Right.
Here, let me try.
What?
The engines are fixed.
I hope not.
And be right back.
It's eating a hole in the floor!
Boy, that's terrific.
Ask him.
Careful, do n't get under it!
How's broussard?
He's running a fever.
Still unconscious?
Yes.
Can you do anything for him?
Got a better idea?
Oh my god.
Does anybody know what happened?
I ca n't, the acid will pour out!
I've completely lost their signal.
Can you get them back?
I'm trying.
What do you mean, no?
We're not going anywhere.
What is it -- i ca n't tell anything --
I think it's fizzled out.
Hey! what about the film?
Listen, had n't somebody better check on broussard?
We sure need this flamethrower.
It's not going to work.
Feast your eyes.
Sandy, can you home in on that beam?
What's the frequency?
Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission?
You lead.
My signal's fading.
How far?
Who knows?
Can you see anything?
What is it?
Yes, thank heaven.
Is it still dripping?
It appears to have healed itself.
We're going into the freezers now.
Maybe we could write it together.
Room by room, corridor by corridor.
They're on the next level up.
Let's get moving with this net.
Could be some kind of venom, or poison ...
Yeah?
Sandy, contact traffic control.
Well, it's finally happened.
No -- that's atmosphere. cloud layer.
Turn on navigation lights.
Engine room, what happened?
Good! moisture content?
Zero. dry as a bone.
Not a one. it's dead.
Anything else?
Yeah, rock particles. dust.
Found what?
What killed it?
Oh well ... you know me.
Good.
Up one kilometer, jay.
Let's take her into an escape orbit.
We're coming!
I guess we open the door and net it.
What do you think? now we go in.
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing.
... more spores coming.
What did it do to you?
Look ...
I'll get you out of there.
No ... do n't ...
Kill me ...
Yeah ...
Is it dead?
Wait a minute.
Thanks.
Yep ...
Okay, give me the numbers.
It's on the board.
What's happening?
Cassie, thank christ! we're under attack.
We're what!?
Too many.
What? what's wrong? what is it?
Comin' up the central reservoir.
And?
Drains right into the central reservoir.
Get her on-line. now!
Shit. when?
You win some, you loose some.
Match it!
Nooooo!
Has anybody talked to them?
Not yet.
Do it.
Yeah?
I dunno.
What?
Take a look at this.
What?
Just got a reading ...
C'mon de vries. think of the bonus.
What?
I'll come with you.
Yeah, i got it.
What's wrong?
I'm picking up another signal.
Just behind us, over to the right.
Yeah, i ...
How?
I dunno. might be a glitch.
It's alright, it's cool ...
Is it still moving?
Thanks.
Uh-huh.
And, nothing. they checked out just fine.
Compensate!
Looks like it.
Right. auto-shop, you all set?
Blow those suckers, driscoll!
And before that?
Only six?
Real man' drink.
Want some?
Check out the tent.
Hold on ...
Detour. other way's blocked ...
Do n't wait for me!
You have to ...
No!
Yeah,'good evening' to you, too.
'bout five minutes.
Give me a yell is something happens.
You got it, cowboy.
It's a very famous name, mr. dewitt.
And what is your name?
Phoebe.
Phoebe?
I call myself phoebe.
Certainly, mr. dewitt ...
Eddie what?
I believe i will.
Just some coffee.
Just like that.
It was n't meant to be.
D-day.
Just like it.
Are n't you?
Frankly- yes.
You know me better than that.
Paved with what, then?
Stars.
Almost four.
Why not?
Lloyd and i.
What else?
You have no right to say such things!
She does n't know.
Yes, you did. you still do.
A dull cliche.
Yes, addison.
You can have one at max's.
I do n't think i'm going.
Why not?
Because i do n't want to.
Then you've heard too.
I was there. an eyewitness.
Margo? lunching in public?
We have that in common.
Then you two must have a long talk-
Being violently ill to her tummy.
Did n't you know?
Of course i knew.
It just slipped your mind.
Frankly, i do n't remember.
Just slipped your mind.
In time she'll be what you are.
Huh?
This is eve harrington.
Where?
Right here. a minute ago.
That's nice.
Geniuses do n't need good luck. i do.
Everything ... everything's so funny ...
I'm a junk yard.
Eve. i'd forgotten they grew that way ...
Huh?
Do n't get stuck on some glamour puss-
I'll try.
Call me when you get in ...
Bill? have i gone crazy, bill?
You're my girl, are n't you?
That i am ...
Then you're crazy.
When- when are you coming back?
I get a party, do n't i?
How is eve? okay?
Okay.
I love you ...
I'll check with eve ...
What?
I love you too. good night, darling-
See you ...
It wo n't play.
Cut it out.
When i'm guest of honor?
I had no idea you were even here.
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
So she seems.
Thirty minutes, forty minutes! what of it?
For instance- you!
Nothing, really ...
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
What's all over?
The audition.
You would n't understand. how was miss caswell?
So full of meaning, fire and music!
The kid. junior.
Gone.
I must have frightened her away.
I mix what i like.
Okay. mix.
Do n't calm down.
You're being terribly tolerant, are n't you?
I'm trying terribly hard.
Paranoiac!
I've been aware of that for some time.
Well, i am.
I'll say.
Do n't be condescending.
The terms are too high. unconditional surrender.
You were great.
Glory hallelujah.
What would you like? texas?
Groom.
Yes, dear.
You know what i'm going to be?
A cowboy.
A married lady.
With the paper to prove it.
Eve. eve harrington.
I just wondered.
Just wondered what?
Why.
Why what?
Why you have to go out there.
I do n't have to. i want to.
Is it the money?
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
It's only one picture deal.
So few come back ...
Also addison dewitt.
Every day.
You did n't have to tell me.
Goodbye, mr. sampson.
What have i got to do with it?
Everything.
From what would i be running?
- and for you.
You're quite a girl.
You think?
No thanks, birdie.
I never played fort sumter.
Buy some.
The same size?
Of course!
Oh, brother.
Miss coonan ...
See you home ...
Hmm?
You do n't like eve, do you?
Do you want an argument or an answer?
An answer.
No.
Why not?
Now you want an argument.
She works hard.
Night an' day.
Like an agent with one client.
Do n't be dense. the party.
Miss harrington ...
What are you doing here?
I- i guess i fell asleep.
That's all.
What for?
You probably wo n't believe me.
Probably not.
It was for my report.
What report? to whom?
I'll just pick up the broken glass.
Do n't bother.
How long does it take?
You rest. i'll get it ...
Oh, no ...
She's got to meet you-
My husband ...
Try ...
Well ...
Not just that way. as a friend ...
I'd like that.
Karen.
I think she would cheer.
They'll do as they're told.
You wo n't forget it?
I wo n't forget.
They certainly do n't waste much time.
I do n't intend to be.
Oh, but there is-
I'm not crying.
- an understudy's performance.
Something most important you can do.
Over my dead body ...
Thank you, karen.
How do you do, mr. richards.
I hope so, mr. richards. good night ...
I wo n't be a minute.
I've got it.
Yes, dear. you forgot all about it.
I would n't like.
I had no idea you knew each other.
She's just outside the door.
The heave-ho.
Roughly ten minutes.
How far to the station?
Three or four miles ...
It does n't matter.
I detest cheap sentiment.
We've all seemed a little tense lately ...
What about bill?
He's in love with you.
Is n't that what they always say?
With tears.
You'll be there, wo n't you.
Loud.
In a minute ...
What is?
Eve.
Eve?
If we could cast it properly, that is ...
They'd die without each other.
Margo!
Nothing much. she apologized.
Nothing ...
Did miss harrington tell you to call mr. richards?
Up in the room.
I will.
The play? all right, i guess ...
Do n't be evasive.
Margo, you have n't got any age.
I'm sure.
She was a revelation ...
To you, too?
What do you mean?
I have no intention of having an accident!
I mean really, deeply angry ...
I do n't think i could be.
We are ready with your call to beverly hills ...
Call, what call?
That's right, but i do n't understand-
Go ahead, please ...
I just played it.
Play it again.
But that was the fourth straight time.
A couple of weeks.
Anything to help you out, max.
This is real cooperation. i appreciate it.
Give eve harrington job in you office.
I promise.
That's my max.
Answer my question!
I said i'm a dying man!
-- it was bullshit the way it was --
-- no way --
-- read'em both and you'll see --
Yeah?
Fuck you, carl.
Let me lay a little theory on you --
Hmm.
-- hunt does n't seem like your ordinary consultant.
Maybe a political operative of some sort --
-- a spy, you mean?
About the past year.
The fucking new york times.
-- see? --
-- i'm trying --
-- fifteen phone calls --
I never scared anyone before.
Anything you've got.
And i'm a republican.
Sure.
Who'd you vote for?
When?

Nixon.
You voted for him.

That happens to people. ok, go on.
-- colson.

-- i know, i know --
-- i know a lawyer at justice --
-- has he got an ax? --
We're inside the white house now.
Who?
Haldeman.
It's nothing personal, though.
What's the matter?
Maybe we are ...
-- he said john haldeman, not bob haldeman --
Hmm?
Goddamnit! --
11:30.
Morning or night?
Night.
Oh.
The telephone calls ... we know about that.
I'd really like to see mr. dardis.
And you will. but not now.
He is not in the car. sorry.
Well of course.
That's right.
Mind if i try?
When did he hire you?
I did n't do anything wrong.
Tell that to muskie.
Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
But you know who did.
Sure -- off the record.
On the orders of haldeman?
-- yes --
We've just been talking to young --
-- deep throat? --
Absolutely --
-- what about you? --
Give me your checkbook then.
It's right under that pile.
There's always a later plane.
Just let me get a match.
The ones who could disburse the money.
Who were they?
What do you want to know?
No games, irwin; give.
I will not talk about the other two.
Kalmbach -- nixon's personal lawyer.
-- this'll only take one second --
I'm not your source on that.
My non-denial denial.
You asking me to disclose my source?
I do n't know titles.
-- his dialing finger must be falling off --
-- what do you think? --
Electronic surveillance.
Ok.
You're a lawyer and you're here --
I have nothing more to say.
Absolutely -- marilyn's gotten it totally wrong --
Yes, sir.
To where?
Go on.
You get nothing from me about haldeman?
Follow every lead -- every lead goes somewhere --
How grand?
James mccord.
Will you step forward, sir.
Security consultant.

Government. recently retired.
Where in government?

It is.
Two o'clock, work the phones'til you go.
Lotsa hints --
-- well, sloan --
Howard --
-- remember toronto, harry.
That was awhile ago.

Larry young, a california lawyer --
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
When so ordered.
I wo n't talk about the other two.
A girl. melissa.
You work there, miss abbott.
I'm not miss abbott.
Sorry.
No, it was good.
Oh, well ... it came from the heart.

She was going through my pocketbook!
They're persecuted enough!
Who's persecuting? she stole!

It's the way they do things.
To code?
A triumph. when did you get here?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
Why did n't you come in?
Would it make a difference?
Absolutely.
Had a little help?
Absolutely not.
It has your ring.
I'm not that good.
And how's the diva doing?
She's got great tits.
She's a constant surprise.
And you've only just met.
The movie.
Any thoughts on casting yet?

Leo. leo's twenty-eight, cal.

Are you asking me to marry you?
Suicidal. it's much less codependent.
Will champagne help?
Not enough.
Oh great.
She's all over him, are you blind?
It could be worse.
How?
You see, that's worse.
They're not just our business managers, panes.

And she left shortly after that?
No further questions.
I'll have you out in a few hours.
Something like that.
We're not animals.
How?
Sure. where to?
I know.
No -- it just does n't look right.
I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
I'm the photographer.
Oh -- well, they're different.
That's not an answer.
It's not my taste.
Tastes can change.
Hi. it's frank.
Hi, frank.
It's okay.
Yeah.
What would?
You and me -- making love.
Is that what you think i was thinking?
What?
That's not good enough, goddamit!
I went out on the boat.
Of course.
It's only the beginning.
You can see me now.
Paley could be a problem tomorrow.
Honey.
Tonight we open new doors.
Are you scared?
He was only doing what he thought was right.
No -- you're not.
No -- i'm a survivor.
She's waiting in the conference room.
I love you too, dad.
Why?
Because i'm expecting a call.
-- but it's sunday.
Mr. roston?
You better. please answer the question.
This is not relaxing.
Really?
Really.
I'm always open to learning new things.
No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.
Yeah -- but can she cook?
Yes.
I can think of worse ways to go --
Why do n't you talk to him now?
We have to talk.
What's wrong?
Why did you lie to me?
You're sleeping with her, are n't you?
No.
Talk to me.
Please -- not now.
Why did n't you come to me?
I do n't know.
It was a place to start.
That's too bad.
Daddy -- stop it!
What time did you leave?
Six thirty -- and he was very much alive.
No -- never.
It had to get there somehow.
It did n't get there from me.
Well, that's a long time.
It's not that long.
I simply can not stand that tone!
Why are there two deeds here?
I said no!
I know. i do n't understand it either.
No treasure maps, huh?
No.
No. you can have them.
Lawyer here?
I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.
Well, there's a problem.
What problem?
Michael.
What?!
Come here a minute.
Well, what am i supposed to think?
Have you called betty? maybe you should.
I bet mom could've helped her.
Nobody did.
Was this during betty?
No, what?
Oh, yes.
She used to be so friendly.
She changed.
Not this kind of heat.
Heat is heat.
Yeah.
That's it.
After the divorce.
Oh.
How long you been married?
Uh ... uh ... umm ... long time.
No, really?
Oh! you caught me.
Want another cigarette?

Oh. michael's 17 and carolyn's 16.
Must be nice having kids.
Why?
Clean?
Yes. very clean.
Much.
Is the dizziness gone?
I think so.
She starts sniffing me.
Oh my god ... you're blushing.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
Then what happened?
We got engaged.
Oh you!
Why, do you think?
You get used to it.
When?
You want to go back in?
Francesca?
What?
Are you all right?
Yes.
Francesca?
What?
We're not doing anything wrong, do you.
Do you ever regret not having a family?
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
But no one in particular.
No. but i love them just the same.
But it's not the same.
What made you ask such a question?
Yes! hi.
Am i interrupting anything?
No. i was just ... no.
I would love to come for dinner.
Wonderful. uh ...
I'll pick you up.
Yeah. see you later.
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
I want you to come.
Oh, how is he?
Sure.
Would you like a beer for your bath?
Yes, that'd be nice.
Are you hungry?
No.
What?
Yes.
How about bari?
Yes.
No. i could n't.
Why do you say that?
Because i already tried once.
No, i do n't mind.
Trouble. why?
I just wondered. why were you trouble?
I had a temper.
What were your parents like?
What?
Am i too heavy for you?
No.
Yes, thanks.
Why?
Because i ca n't have you!
What does that have to do with it?
To hell with you!
Later. go back to sleep.
Where you going?
I ca n't sleep.
Again? maybe you should see a doctor.
I'm going to miss you.
It's only four days.
Hmm?
Nah.
What's her name?
Betty.
What's she like?
Okay.
What happened?
They're not going to find her!
Yes, they are.
Apparently just before her death.
You people really do n't like dogs.
He yours, sir?
Hell no!
Then what do you care?
How the hell should i know?
Yeah?
Damn. it's so ... fresh.
Spooked?
Maurice left. tia's taking a bath.
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Climb out to where?
Anywhere but here.
That's some terrible shit.
Bones.
I do alright. everybody's happy.
But things change. you got ta think ahead.
I said, no thanks.
Go on. it wo n't kill you.
Where we'll always be ...
But.
Hush, baby.
Since we was just grasshoppers ...
How did you get in here?
Then fuck it!!!
I have to finish this for class.
All the more reason i should be here.
Please. it's for your own good.
Your father. he was your father.
I manage them.
That place is already bad luck.
Why?
Or the living fall in. who knows.
And you believe her?
What? oh yeah. coming.
Bill! bill?!
Patrick, he's ...
Okay, okay. listen:
Here!
I ca n't!
Back here. at the end of the block.
You got the shit?
Let me see it.
Where is it?
Dad?
Just a visit with my old pal, jay-bird.
Do n't call me that.
That's it. get out. now!
It was just like in my head.
Yeah, you heard of him?
You have n't?
Not that i remember.
No thanks.
That building?
Moe's terms.
Ours!
Here, put this in his mouth.
You want to get into this now?
No, no, caesar. not now.
I'll have whatever violet's drinking.
Two point one seventy-six.
Just admit it, caesar.
Admit what?
Open the case!
All right! where's the key?
You do n't need a key.
The same way you did before.
What are you talking about?
Where is it?
Where's what?
The money!
Yeah, i know.
No, caesar, gim me the gun.
Stay away!
No!
Gim me the gun.
I ca n't. i ca n't.
Give it to me.
All part of the business.
What the fuck is going on?
Caesar, this is corky. corky, caesar.
Jesus, caesar!
That's none of your goddamn business, caesar.
It was unbelievable! un-fucking- believable!
Ummm ... in the linen closet.
There's no time.
What are you talking about?
They just left, did n't they?
What are you, drunk?
No! they're still on their way.
That does n't make any sense.
Why?
Because i just saw johnnie downstairs.
It was him. i'm positive.
It's impossible!
Caesar, maybe we should run --
Violet, please!
No.
The hell i ca n't!
I need you ...
Caesar, what are you going to do?
Caesar, what are we going to do?
Caesar, someone could see us out here.
Where, then?
We're going to need some time.
Who are you going to call?
Do n't tell him --
Shut up, violet!
He ca n't kill you --
Not until he has the money!
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Do n't try to tell me what to do.
You need the money just like we do.
Shut up, violet.
Let us go and we'll make a deal.
Everything you could n't.
You murdered gino!
I had to. you made me.
They were in a car accident.
But everybody is all right.
They're all fine. just bruises and shit.
I should have let him kill you.
You know he would have done you, too.
I knew i could n't trust you.
Pretty good, sir.
Oh, right.
Where's the fucking money?
No. rajeev's in india.
Five.
What? how about a drink?
Sure.
Lick me.
Where is it?
Why?
I could be lying.
Hey, mickey.
Caesar, you still got the money?
I thought i heard someone knocking.
Me? why?
Yeah.
Why'd you move all the furniture around?
Yeah, that's it.
Where in the hell is he?
Ssh! i ca n't hear gino!
Oh yeah. violet!
Leave your phone on the hook.
This is the police, ma'am.
How do i know you are cops?
All right.

A beer?
A beer. of course.
Maybe.

Tell me about it.
You have to ask?
No.
Basically.
How long have you been with him?
Almost five years.
Five years is a long time.
Yes, it is.
What?
I'm glad you did.
So am i.
Nothing.
I'm not afraid of anything.
I do n't understand-?
What the fuck was it?
Work.
You mean shelly?
Do n't tell me, you're a workaholic.
I think so, too.
Yes.
He was in love with you, right?
How much money?
Shelly said it was over two million dollars.
I think ...
Yeah.
Then what? exactly.
He hung it up.
What?
To let it dry.
In his office. i saw it this morning.
Does the case lock?
Good.
Johnnie?
Why?
... shit.
Sweet jesus.
What happened?
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Has caesar ever seen him?
He does it right in front of him.
It's getting better and better. keep going.
Waiting in the apartment next door.
Shit! oh shit!
He wo n't.
If he does ...
Why?
Thank you.
I wo n't.
I think we're going to find out.
What happened?
That means he probably will kill johnnie.
I'm still here.
I was so afraid you ...
Do n't be sorry. help me.
Hey.
How'd it go?
I'm here, are n't i?
... me neither.
Hey, johnnie ...
Caesar? what the fuck time is it?
I think everything is okay.
Violet?
Yes.

Thanks.
Any place.

I would appreciate a little space. thank you.
Do i hear a woman's voice?
Taking messages.
You could've made me lose my call.
Did you have to tell her my name?
You got ta just look the other way.
You could've killed us.
Why would i do that?
I'm going to level with you officer.
It's taken care of.
That's your `` rep.''
If you know that just back off.
Make a `` u'' and go back.
Satisfied, wiseass?
I'm doing fine. theo wants to deal.
What am i supposed to do?
I was worried about you. both of you.
And what're you whispering for?
They're holding my husband downstairs.
I do n't want to know --
My name is lenore oberfeld.
Oh wo n't i?
Because you know you'll be killing us.
Do n't lay this on me!
Then hang up! do it!
Shit!
Another minute.
What about the others?
Tell me what she looks like.
Hey drop it, okay?
Sometimes i paint.
Our house always needs touching up.
Pictures.
That's not her.
No.
I've got to ask somebody.
She's gone --
What bank?
What do you mean?
Do n't say that.
Do you know what's in that box?
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
Do n't talk. do n't talk!
What's going on?
No.
Did you hear that click?
Yes -- i think so. another crossed line?
Or somebody else there is listening in --
What did you do?
Are you okay?
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
That's coming off. how about the girl?
Yes.
Put the man back on.
Can you walk?
Shit. i'm sorry.
Why did n't you just shoot them?
They put their hands all over me.
There is n't any such person.
Whose money is this?
Jack oberfeld in person. did you kill him?
Damned if i know.
They always pick rachel up early on thursday.
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
You knew about me.
L.a.p.d.
What's that supposed to me?
Naturally you did n't learn your lesson.
259-7881.
Ask them.
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
How about `` later?''
We ca n't leave him to repeat anything.
Naturally.
Naturally.
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
Only one way to find out.
That's how it's going to be.
Took preparation.
Exactly who was this oberfeld?
Take your hand out of there. slowly.
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
Pull over! pull over someplace.
Who is this?
You must n't hang up.
Sure.
Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot.
We do n't see you.
I still do n't see you.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
And not a nickel.
She's yours. what are we waiting on?
I'm backing up.
Do n't worry.
Put the girl on.
Better reassure him.
Call me `` nels.''
I thought you'd know me by now.
What does it take to kill you?
I suppose you're in your taxi?
Five minutes.
Where do i turn?
We're gon na get there first.
How do you know?
Stay put! i know my way around.
Them. they wo n't be expecting us.
Mind if i have a look?
Let me talk to the lady again.
There's no lady here.
Government business?
Very official. 259-7881, if i recall.
Undercover.
I thought so.
Yeah.
Is that good or bad?
Thanks.
So who's he?
He's what she should run a mile from.
Then why does n't she?
Who knows the secrets of the human heart.
I'm sorry.
How?
Whatever you say.
See what, dil?
He gave me a look.
Did he?
Yeah?
What you think?
Nice.
What would you call it?
Now, that was a look.
What do you think his name is?
I've no thoughts on the subject.
Hi, jimmy.
Persistent.
Good thing in a man.
An excellent quality.
Maybe he wants something.
I would expect he does.
Ask him yourself.
Hi.
No. tell him to go fuck himself.
Saw it, dil.
Fuck it, is what i say.
Yeah. fuck it, dil.
Fucking men, col --

Maybe.
Cunt.
Charming.
It's dave.
Please, dil --
Do n't throw my clothes out the window!
Fucking mad!
Take your fucking goldfish, too!
Fuck off, dave.
He wants to know do i mean that.
What?
Whatever it is she does for you.
It's a simple question.
Two hundred quid, mr. deveroux.
Your pat just cost me two hundred quid.
Off his wages.
Bloody right i do ...
In a way.
Who?
Guy i work with.
What's his name?
What's it to you?
Nothing.
No.
Not english.
Scottish?
How'd you guess?
The accent, i suppose.
And what's it like?
Like treacle.
Who's she?
Do n't know. who is she?
He's scottish, col.
Jimmy?
Not me.
Must be.
Hi. you forgot your bag.
They all get the wrong idea.
Yes, thank you.
What was that all about?
He wants me to perform for him.
Perform?
You know.
You on the game?
God no. i'm a hairdresser.
You ca n't leave me then, can you?
No, i did n't --
What look?
The one you gave me in the metro.
They're jealous.
Why?
I wonder.
How special?
You want one?
Jesus.
The things a girl has to put up with.
Yes, please.
What'll it be?
Whiskey.
Jesus fucking christ.
Does n't know the meaning of the word.
Tried to. sit down, will you?
How different?
As different as it's possible to be.
Tell me about him.
No.
Should n't i go?
Yes.
Did you do that to him?
Yes ...
Are you jealous of him?
Maybe.
That's good ...
What do you think?
I think you do.
You say that like a gentleman.
Do i?
Like you're concerned.
Did n't think i could.
A real gentleman ...
I am.
Is this an obsession of yours?
Maybe.
He did sometimes.
Did he dance with you?
Want to look after you.
What does that mean?
Something i heard someone say once.
Yeah.
What is this?
I'm superstitious. drink.
Aha.
The thing is, can you go the distance?
Depends what it is.
No, depends on nothing.
I'm thinking of your man.
Why?
I'm wondering why you keep his things.
Told you, i'm superstitious.
All the time.
No ...
Dil --
Tell him it hurt --
I have to talk to her, col --
Where?
Sorry, darling.
Give it over, dil --
Apologies, my sweet.
Do you care, jimmy?
Sure i do.
You mean that?
Yeah. i care, dil.
Shut up.
Made me feel all funny inside.
I said stop it.
Ask me to meet you again, jimmy.
You think that's wise?
Nothing's wise.
I know that.
That's a start.
So i'm sorry.
Make it up to me, then.
How?
Ask to meet me again.
Will you meet me again?
When?
Whenever. tonight.

So they do know.

You could say that.
And you're not going to tell me more?
I ca n't.
I'm not sure.
Do you like me even a little bit?
More than that.
Anything.
You'd do anything for me?
Afraid so.
You got the keys to the shop?
No. sit down.
A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
Want to change you to a man, dil ...

Who's the old geezer?
Some judge ...
I take pride in my work.
I sincerely hope so.
Get that thing off me, fergus --
Do you want a cup of tea?
Why would you do that?
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
So?
And anyway, he's seen our faces.
You sure?
It's your decision.
I told him.
Are you all there?
And do you know why?
Why?
I'm a volunteer, am n't i?
What?
Request permission to guard the prisoner tonight --
Would make me feel better about it.
You sure about that?
I'm sure.
Okay. you're a good man, fergus.
Who'd you think it was?
I thought it was dave.
And who's dave when he's at home?
He's at home.

No. it's the truth.
Well, i could say the same about you.
Could you?
What is it now?
Kill me.
You want to bet?

And you know the funny thing?
No, what's the funny thing?
I did n't even fancy her.
She's not my type.

Jody's always right.
Like having a pint in the metro --
My special friend.
Oh, yeah.
We got simple tastes, you and me.
The best.
I've often wondered how you do it.
Depends on what you believe in.
What do you believe in?
That you guys should n't be here.
It's as simple as that?
Yes.
Some kinds of women are ...
Dil was n't trouble. no trouble at all.
You liked her?
Want you to do something, fergus.

If they kill me --
Do n't think that way.

I think you're overreacting.
Are you all right?
That's a big question.
I hope it was n't something i did.
Something you did?
Yes, i suppose so.
This has been really difficult, this whole thing.
Especially this last year.

I need to talk to annette.
She's not here.
Do you know where she is?
She's out.
Do you know when she'll be back?
It's really important.
I understand. good night.

We played backgammon?
Uh huh. you beat me three times.
I did?
Yep. then i fucked your daughter.
Excuse me?
Oh ... no thank you ...
Eight o'clock. you got to go.
Did she show up?
Nope.
Do you mind if i check upstairs?
Do n't worry about it.
She really loves me.
What are you talking about?
Kathryn. did you hit her?
You bastard!
I was n't saying anything. i was singing.
Yes, darling.
Did you ever make a wish?
Oh, lots of times.
Did your wishes ever come true?
Sometimes.
At the old house with the voice.
The farren house
Do you know the people?
I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
What's her name?
Irena.
Irena.
I know that.
It's early yet.
That's right.
What do you mean?
Well, it seemed to me --
You're shouting at me.
I thought amy was calling. i guess not.
What?
It's your play.
Well, you know where it is.
Are you coming to see us. miss callahan?
No, darling, i had n't intended to.
I live right here.
Maybe i'll drop in and see your mommy.
Did you mail then?
Yes, i did.
Where did you mail them?
I'll show you.
Yes, daddy.
Certain wishes do.
Why did n't you run after them?
It's true.
And who did the voice belong to?
It was just a voice.
Let me be the judge of that.
Voices from an old dark house!
And this one's for mrs. farren.
Yes, amy?
Why, daddy, you know my friend too!
She's there whenever i call her!
Yes, darling.
I do n't know yet.
You called me by my name.
Irena. but who are you?
I'm your friend.
I've wanted a friend.
I can not tell you.
Will you be friend for always?
For as long as you'll let me.
I shall want you for always.
Whenever you want.
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
But you must!
The numbers simply do n't mean anything
That's right!
This is more fun than just pretend.
Of course,
That one's an elm.
My dolls. we can pretend.
A merry christmas to you, amy.
You wanted to share this moment with me.
It stands so still.
Do n't cry, amy.
But she's dead!
Yes, amy.
But why?
That's a fine-looking ring.
A lady threw it to me.
Let me take another look at that ring.
Soon as i finish.
But what happened to the little deer?
Why has n't he got a head?
Do n't you hear it?
Do n't you read shakespeare?
Yes, yes-
Yes, barbara ... barbara ...
Good night ... barbara ...
Now, i do n't know amy --
None
She pleaded so to do it
So do i, mr. reed.
Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
Can we get some service here?
James dean, humphrey bogart ...
Yeah but they looked cool ...
Your lips look delicious.
I've been working out.
At victoria's secret.
I mean where on your body?
Oh, on my wrist.
No, it was another woman.
Good. except for pms.
How have you been feeling?
No it's mom.
Mom!
Anything's better than mark.
My shrink says he's not so bad.
Maybe he's just shy.
I'd kill for just a little bloated.
Only to see.
Ca n't you get contacts?
Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
Frida, grab that red one.
And she got the medium.
And he was ripped limb from limb?
I'm sure they were exaggerating.
Why would they exaggerate?
Did i kill him? of course not!
No, did you fuck him?
No. i do n't think so.
And my bra finally fits again.
I wonder if he's married.
What the hell is the tampon test?
I looked like an italian man!
I think he called you beautiful.
It is so hot in here.
I put it down the garbage disposal.
And what makes you think you killed a man?
I have n't gotten it yet.
Tuesday. are you okay?
Shit, i guess i missed work.
Frida, carlton's dead.
Oh no.
And he was missing an arm.
Okay, i got ta go.
Did you get rid of mark?
Yeah, i guess. mark?
Why not? there's been a murder.
There's kind of this guy i'm seeing.
I could smell another woman on him.
No.
Ignore it.
Hide him.
Does that mean this whole thing is over?
So what do i do?
Fall in love.
I think i already have.
About mark? carlton?
About benito.
Did i kill a guy named benito?
Frida? you okay?
So you're grant's secretary?
I do development for tv movies.
Starving.
That's great. highly original.
I really got ta pee.
You should have gone at the restaurant.
I did n't have to pee then.
My apartment's just such a mess.
Knock what off?
You do n't have to pee.
Yes i do have to pee!
So pee? here?
Since when do you care?
You never say that.
Oh my god, i'm sorry!
Frida, you know you're it for me.
Yeah right ... you better go.
This really is n't a good time.
My bra is my biggest supporter.
Yeah?
Take your shower.
On your desk.
Script coverage?
On your desk.
Coffee and ...
Your desk.
Did you change your hair?
A little.
No?
Are you following me?
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
Oh, it's nothing.
No really, i love knowing what people read.
It's stupid.
I can forgive you a bestseller.
Used to? did it stop finally?
No, she died when i was twelve.
I'm sorry.
Briefs.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
I'm sorry -- i'm on edge today.

Why do men and women usually see each other?
Not good enough.

The way you've underestimated bud white?
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
How about white?
Actually, bud's only tough on the outside.
Right now, before i back down.

Ben. are you okay?
Yeah, nine years straight.
O-kay. we'll skip that question.
Yeah. i can tell. victor was right.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Do n't you wander off, boy.
I already got it. everything i want.
About me? how sweet.
What is this? where's reed?
The suit will stretch. you should try it --
I would n't be caught dead in that.
Oh, he did.
Victor must've taken him.
That's terrible news ...
Ben! ben!
Cool. what'd it do to you guys?
You've been working out.
I can go hotter!
But all these people ...
< u> now< /u>.
So are you!
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
Stay right. left is trouble.

Raising the shields.
You ca n't leave them out there.
Victor, are you feeling alright?
Just< u> find< /u> him.
Oh, i think you already have.
Medical's ready.
Phase two.
I know that. but what's the maximum?
Nothing -- compared to starting it up again.
I'd hold that off awhile.
The other side got to him.
How bad off is he?
Brain injury.
Before or after what he wanted to tell you?
< me>?
Say that again?
Trip? where to?
As part of the crew.
But i do n't want to be miniaturized --!
It's only for an hour --
Yes?
Where can i get a cab back to town?
That's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty.
With no laser --
Yes, cora.
I -- i want to say ...
I'll take some laughing gas, ma'am.
Now i know ...
Not working for someone like dr. duval --
I have no idea.
Not now. we need air, not greetings!
A surgeon might ...
I ca n't till the hatch is flooded!
I feel much better now ...
That's what they pay me for.
A great deal more than that, i believe ...
Keeping an eye on dr. duval ...
What gives you that idea?
Nothing -- against all that force.
All i'm asking is you test it beforehand!
You left something out.
What's that?
The breath of god ...
No, there's no other way.
What about dr. michaels?
It's too late!
At an operation?
How are you, miss peterson?
If there's any chance --
Request removal, mr. grant.
That line was tampered with ...
It's possible --
Where we going?
Go ahead.
I'm married.
And she said it was indelible ...
That makes two of us.
Positions, please. and strap yourselves in.
Enough to breathe, but that's all.
Dr. michaels ... he went berserk ...
We can get out through the lab section.
I could use a lawnmower ...
Looks simple to operate.
I'll do what i can.

To do nothing.
That's right.
One word to i.a. and he walks.

I'm always all business.
That's not what he thinks.
What did he look like?

Ran like hell to go to him ...
You do n't know.
She did n't tell me.
Good to see you, too, randy.
You're not missing much.

My arm!
Who?
She used some stupid code name.
What was it?
The phone call. the knapsack.
You're going to be brought in for questioning.
Yes down at the station.
But she was an attractive girl.
I suppose.
Did you have sex with her?
But you wanted to.
I was a mentor to her.
Yes.
Expensive dresses. a heart necklace.
Yes.
Does n't sound like a mentor to me.
He. well, he ...
Told you i could write an ending.
Congratulations.
There's nothing more to talk about.
But we work so well together ...
Then so was mine ...
Do n't you pull that shit with me.
I did n't want to kill her, will.
This an accident, walter?
If you want it to be ...
No back-up.
You're not following procedure.
Procedure went out the window a long time ago.
Drop the gun, walter.
Yes, and very beautiful.
Your lips, they did n't move.
But how did you come into existence?
Ah! you have questions?
What are we?
Nothing if not vampires ...
Who made us what we are?
Surely you know the one who made you ...
You mean we are not children of satan?
No.
Perhaps ...
Then god does not exist ...
I have not spoken to him ...
Knew? you mean he is ...
Listen to me.
Your lover.
No, my beloved, my child.
If you say so. you are innocent.
But why?
How he must have loved you.
Yes ... my god ...
Follow me- that way- through my cell-

Why not?
Do n't mock me, louis. help me.
The swamp ...
I ca n't. go away from me.
It is! take the back stairwell-
Not yet.
Still my beautiful child.
And no one knows but us ...
Yes, and very beautiful.
You really believe that?
It's only mortal death.
Then my luck would have changed.
You want death? is it death you want?
Yes ...
Why should i be?
Vampires. we thrive on blood.
I want it!
Call him.
I ca n't do it.
You've just done it-
But why do you want me?
Yes ...
Sure ...
I want a woman.
The crucifix-
Forget the crucifix. take him.
You have fed. you were made for this ...
You've killed louis. and enjoyed it.
Yes. and i'm bored with this prattle --
Read her thoughts.

I'll remember that. what do you do?
I'm a housewife.
Then why are you eating alone?
Why do men chase women?

I do n't know.
You see that moon last night?
I knew she had it.
She looks like one. yes, she does.
Bring her forward.
Did you dress her up like this?
Burn them.
And what do you burn, apart from witches?
Yes!
You're using coconuts!

Am i right?
I'm not interested.
Seek you the bridge of death ...
The britons.
Who are the britons?
All of us are ... we are all britons.
Well, who is your lord?
We do n't have a lord.

Of course.
And not too expensive.

None shall pass.
So be it!

A scratch? your arm's off.

Good concorde ... stay here and rest awhile.

Oh ... that's awfully nice.
Father, lad.
I'd rather ... just ... sing ...

Quick!
Why?
You are in great peril.
We'll cover your escape!
Look- i'm fine!

No, i'm not.
Ector.
They're doctors?
We must examine you.
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
Please ... we are doctors.
I'm sorry, i must go.
Well ... yes ...
You've come to rescue me?
Well ... yes ... but i had n't realised ...
He's come to rescue me, father.
Well, let's not jump to conclusions ...
Do n't say that word.
Look. i'm warning you.
What's he do? nibble your bum?
Shut up.
I did n't.
Bravely ran away, away.
No, no, no.
I speak as i find, archie.
Not down south you do n't.
Seventy a year.
Not bad, not bad.
How about yourself?
Sixty.
It's only grief makes her like she is.
You know what i mean.
I'm not sure i do, archie.
The good-looking one.
Aye, but will they?
I'm getting dressed.
You've got three broken ribs, man!
I've got my duties to attend to.
She'll get over it.
I ca n't let her down now, archie.
She means it.
It's a diary.
Be careful who sees it.
What do you take me for?
I ca n't move to tidy.
It's what the maids are for.
Mary taylor, sir.
Have i seen you up in balmoral, mary?
I hope to go up next year.
Louder, girl!
Checked and locked, sir.
Kitchen and lower house.
Mr brown, sir --
It's cold out there tonight, barney.
Good man. and is she all right?
Yeah.
Are you all right, barney?
I take no account of gossip, your highness.
My concern is for the reputation of the monarchy.
Of course.
I beg your pardon? mama ...?
She's busy.
Convey her a message.
Whom you address.
The future king!
Out of my way!
It is quite late enough.
And that is my last word on the matter.
My own.
You'll talk when i'm finished!
Back and upper corridors.
I'm sorry?
How will i know what she requires?
You'll be sent a message.
Who'll bring it to me?
I need a man who knows where i am.
Yes. i do.
I beg your pardon?
Is that the queen's request?
Yes, it most certainly is!
That can wait till the weekend.
There are important papers from --
It can wait. anything else?
Do n't think i ca n't persuade her.
I am a blank sheet.
Do you hunt?
Occasionally.
Dare say you can be taught.
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
If you hunt, you kill.
You're injured.
It's nothing.
Oh.
This is the top.
Surely --
What i do, i do for my queen.
Was there never ambition?
Maybe, once.
Then i envy yo.
Why?
For her majesty.
Aye.
But yourself? what about john brown?
I said. i serve the queen.
No other aspiration?
See what?
Too busy looking after themselves.
The greasy pole.
No loyalty.
No love.
In time, she will.
She'll think i betrayed her.
Ma'am.
You are here safely.
Aye, ma'am.
You are well?
I am.
And the pony?
She's well, too.
I'm glad of it.
Yes. that will be company for you.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Then why do you persist in doing it?
He thought so, yes.
Yes.
What?
Those, over there, there.
I am told so.
Who by?
Sir henry ponsonby tells me they are charming.
What does he know about the highlands?
He has been attending at balmoral for many years.
That does n't make him an expert.
To keep out the cold.
Aye.
I heard something.
Yes, ma'am?
I was told you were in a fight.
Yes, ma'am.
Has someone seen to those bruises?
Yes, ma'am.
Yes?
Because i have to!
Oh, several things.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
Is that not enough?
Yes.
The cartoon or her majesty's absenteeism?
Well, both.
The question is, do we need her?
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense --
We'll see which way the wind blows.
I hope he got his mother's permission.
To know when he'll be king.
You ca n't know that for sure.
Mrs brown.
What's her excuse this time?
Excellent!
Dear oh dear.
No, indeed.
Whom?
Cold is good!
Yes, ma'am.
What is he doing there?
He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
Mr brown is unable to attend today.
Why?
I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
Unwell?
I understand he was in a fight.
Has he been hurt?
A few days, ma'am.
Why was i not told earlier?
Of course, at once.
And now i am back.
Again?
Read it!
I have no idea.
Why not?
What is it?
I have a letter, ma'am.
From whom?
From princess helena and other members of your family.
Prince albert is at windsor, ma'am.
Why is he not here?
He is sick, ma'am.
Then why are you not with him?
He has typhoid fever, ma'am.
Yeah, who is n't.
He?
How'd you know it was us?
It's the game, arcade.
You do n't like it?
What the hell does that mean?
Did you play arcade last night?
Hey, kid.
We are talking ...
No, in person. now.
It's twelve-thirty!
I'm coming over.
I'm in the middle of it ...
Turn if off!
You imagined it.
Call the others. laurie, benz ...
She thought benz was at school.
Laurie's.
Let's go around back.
What?!
We ca n't ...
My house. i want to try something.
What?
The police, then ...
I do n't know.
What?
And beat it at it's own game.
Drives'em crazy every time.
I ca n't believe you made it!
Everything.
Yeah. the inferno.
You did n't hear me?
Yes i am ...
What?
I know. it sucks.
We're actually inside, are n't we?
One. in case ...
Do n't even say it.
Yeah, well i figure these are unusual circumstances.
That's what i was hoping you'd say.
You've got the schematics, check.
Right, then ...
What?! there's nothing here!
Look around ...
Screamer.
We do n't have a choice!
There never is.
So tell me you're okay, then.
I'm okay.
Sure. never come back. disappear forever.
Hold my keys, then.
Well, it's a long story ...
Thought so.
Then we'll go home.
That way.
In this world, wrong is right!
Oh god ... oh god ...
Is that your question?
Wait! no! that's not it!
I'm thinking!
You have no time.
Of course i am.
But i do n't understand ...
The game will guide you.
Sign me up.
Can you say anything but `` cool''?
Give her a chance, will you?
What's going on, cynthia?
They fired everyone.
Who fired everyone?
I know. where are you adam?
What do you mean `` you know''?
You're broke!
But i'm not broke.
The cowboy??
It's been a very strange day.
Will you meet with him?
I'm just offering a place to stay.
There is no problem.
I'll speak to someone.
Howdy to you.
Yeah.
What did i say?
You're an understandin' fella.
Have a good evening, mr. kesher.
I told ya.
Wow!
You got it! see you later honey.
I was afraid of that.
It's all right gorgeous. something wrong?
Good luck, honey!

Was anyone hurt?
May i have your name please?
Diane?

What do you mean? you're rita.
You do n't remember anything else?
Mulholland drive?
That's where i was going ... mulholland drive.
Not that i can see.
We'll take our check.
Maybe it's not me.
Call the number.
I'm not sure about this.
`` then they'd put you in jail.''
What is it? what do you see?!
Those men in front, in the car.
Do you know them?!
No ... but ...
Keep going. go around to the back.
And who are we auditioning for today?
Wally brown.
Okay. why this denny's?
Go ahead.
I had a dream about this place.
Oh boy.
You see what i mean ...

Yeah.
Could be unrelated.
That's what i'm thinkin'.
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
Where at?
Palmdale.
Damn, that's a long drive.
Hardly.
Not a coke or anything?
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
No ...
Yeah, i'd say that's it.
I have an embezzler and his accomplice.
Please do n't be alarmed, ma'am.
No time. get him up.
Leave him, he's dead.
No!
Embezzling? i'm not embezzling!
I do n't know.
We wait. this is an elevator.
We have to climb up that.
Give me a fucking ... ..
I'm working on it.
I'm leaving.
What?
You took an awful big risk back there.
Then he is n't embezzling either is he?
Why would he? his parents are rich.
We drown.
Obviously, but what's the way out?
Excuse me?
Why did you build this whole place?
Is this really the time?
Do you have something better to talk about?
Know what? that it was your fault?
Fine ...
The brooklyn bridge.
Yes.
I work here, remember?
That was eleven years ago.
Yeah a real shame.

He probably has a history of this shit.
Yeah, but we're talking 43.
Fire the whole division.
Excuse me, sir?

And how much do we pay you annually?
I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.
Better, sir.
Sir?

Then what do you want?
No i am not.
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
Bruce has just awaken.

You do n't think he'd be� helpful?
One of these days.
I do not joke in my proposal.
Who's to say my monsters are n't alive?
Where?
In there.
It frightens me.
I ca n't imagine anything dead playing that music.
I'm not sure ...
What do you mean?
Be careful! -- they'll see you.
Do n't let them hear you.
What can we do?
Whatever you do, do n't do that.
Be careful!
I am -- it's our only chance.
Nothing is worth your life.
Hold on just a little longer, shirley.
Yes i feel it in my bones.
You're talking nonsense.
That sudden?
Of course i do.
A situation easily remedied.
Tie them that they may watch.
A symbol, master.
What kind of symbol?
It would seem so, master.
Ahh, she will be yours.
When!?
Ahh, there is yet time.
Well then let us proceed.
For what!?!
Your pleasures of course!
You mean ...!
You may take her now.
Is there time?
You better hope there is.
Thank you, master! thank you.
Yes, master.
Live ones where only the dead should be?
We do n't know of anything, master ...
Then why do you shake so?
Hurt her? hell, it killed her!
What do you suppose for?
Aannnnaahhnn.
I ca n't remember doing anything wrong either.
Without the snake, of course.
What're you talking about?
Yes, it is.
Uh -- sorry. wrong number.
Who is it?

He called the day he escaped.
Who are you?
Thank you.
Yes.
You did work for emil, right?
His assistant.
Just that she got away.
You better come see this.

A girl.

It smelled.
Having it cleaned did n't help, huh?
Well, does it make sense to you?
I called your room from downstairs.
So do you.
That's not what you were about to say.
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
Yeah, but in a nice way.
Why not?
Where?
Outside adele's.
To warn her about chino.
So she did help you?
I do n't think we should get into that.

You know what i mean.

Get a life.
Not especially.
How many do you know?
Lots.
Who?
Since when?
Probably since she was born.
Yeah ...?
Night, honey.
Why did n't you cross at the crosswalk?
Why should i?
Any women on board?
Like ... two sailors playing hide the salami.
How did you do that?
Yes, we did.
On behalf of the defendants?
You had one guy `` like that?''
Dr. j.!
Andy, you do n't want this.
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
Charles ...
Lookit. lookit!
< u> what< /u>?
What whispers?
They're coming.
But i just wanted to say --
Hunger. i see 60 years of hunger.
< u> listen< /u>.
Get out of our way.
One or two.
Audrey?
You sure you can keep --
As fast as you can.
I ca n't ... .i ca n't ....
Here. make it easy on you.
Do n't do this to me ....
Just give me your hand.
But they ... they could still be ....
I would try for them.
You barely know them.
It's starting ....
Like the light is scalding it.
It hurts them. light actually hurts them ....
How many bottles?
Not sure. ten?
Awright. so maybe we'll have enough light.
What, switch what?
Hey, who?
Hey, me. over here.
Carolyn fry. i'd shake hands, but ...
Big evil?
We just keep him locked up forever?
Tell me it's not a mirage.
Probably right.
Promise me. swear to me you wo n't --
What?
Like what?
So why is n't it all bloody?
I assume he licked it clean.
Thought you did n't believe his story.
Wha'?
Never said you were a hype, either.
'sokay,'sokay. i killed it.
For your own fear.
What the hell's it matter?
How much?
79 kilos.
Riddick.< u> riddick< /u>.
Some prophet guy?
We're all on the same hajj now.
For now.
Riddick?
What?
Do what i say. please.
And what about the cells?
Which half?
You mean ....
Blessing you like the others. it's painless.
And pointless.
Get the girl back under. keep going.
Suleiman!
Keep going or i will!
I'm born-again.
Anyone else having breathing problems? aside from me?
Not staying in here another ....
Not afraid of the dark, are you?
Well, you got the big gauge.
Wan na rag your fat mouth?
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
How'bout a cut in your gut?
Well, what's it look like now?
Looks clear.
Just realized that, huh?
What if you're one of five?
What do you care?
So much for my cocktail hour.
What, it's broken?
Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. take it.
Did you forget our appointment, cornelius?
Do you have any weapons?
The best. but we wo n't need them.
Just the same, i want one.
No.
Neither do i.
Remembers what?
The blood transfusion.
Oh, cornelius, be quiet.
It's probably wrong --
You did n't think so then.
Yo!
Geiger counter?
Yo!
Good question. landon -- check your communications kit.
No.
That way.
Any particular reason?
None at all.
Him.
Sustained.
Do n't be silly. he's perfectly tame.
See? he keeps pretending he can talk.
Huh?
He's trying to form words.
What signal?
To earth! that we've landed!
Forget it. abandon ship.
We're here to stay.
You do n't seem very cut up about it.
Let's take a look.
Okay.
Try telling them our names.
Zira does n't want your female.
I want her.
I'm for that.
Relax. you'll see it all later.
I think you're making a mistake.
That's the boy. keep'em flying.
What?
He would n't leave her.
Keep moving. we ca n't turn back now.
The hunt club.
To scare off humans?
A man, dr. maximus.
We're -- conducting a new experiment.
My name is taylor.
Dr. zira! silence that man!
Mind your tongue, madame.
Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
Identify him, then. speak to him.
You lied. where is your tribe?
When were the sacred scrolls written?
Twelve hundred years ago.
Cease fire! withdraw!
What is this?
A hearing.
Which one?
Second from the left.
Yes.
You want her that much?
It's humiliating.
We ca n't.
It's better than going to prison for heresy.
Of course. he saw you moving yours.
But perhaps he understood --
Like you, i find it difficult.
Where are they now?
What?
Where?
Kill you motherfucker!!!
Says he ca n't walk.
Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
What?
You lame or something?
Barnes comes from hell.
'lias come naturally.
I got one ...
Over here!
Out there man- behind the log.
No!
Yeah. how'bout you?
Yeah.
Then the worm has definately turned for you man.
Dawn ...
... beautiful night.
And you, do you believe?
No ... i move faster alone.
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
What you got there- beers?
Nah ...
Later ...
... there's nobody.
Sounds like it.
What are you talking about!
You know what i'm talking about!
Merle? jesus! ... patty?
Found it. growing in a garden.
That's what he is ... baaaa!
You do n't want to hear about it?
This is one time we could sure use elias.
Vancouver, b.c.
I'm going to vancouver, mr. mitchell.
Indefinitely?
I do n't know.
You do n't know.
No thanks?
Thank you.
What's the matter?
I'm sure you have.
Would you mind?
Okay. you win.
Why certainly, baby.
Just drunk enough.
How soon can i get a plane to seattle?
Possibly, miss.
I'm miss mayfield. is mr. campbell here?
It might be worth a martini to you.
Whatever you say.
I did n't say anything.
Thanks for the fresh air. that felt good.
You're sure mr. brandon wo n't mind?
No thank you.
I do n't.
How did you meet him?
There was n't any plane.
No thanks.
Bad enough.
That's putting it mildly.
Quarter after one. why?
Just who are you, anyway?
Is this the best you can do?
Dance? here?
Why not?
They know you here -- know your name.
Could n't be.
Then he's --
Absolutely sure.
We'll find out.
All right -- following me.
Why?
Nothing matters.
No use waiting, then.
From you, i like it.
They're going to arrest me.
I know. killaine has a warrant.
You leave it.
Frozen.
If you're doing all this just for me.
That, and the fun of it.
You think magruder wants to hang beside me?
Do you think i was faking?
Beer or ale, miss?
Ale. i do n't mind.
Right, miss.
I do n't know her.. or particularly want to.
It is?
I'm sorry.
Yes.
Where's you get it?
A graduation present.
You must come from pretty far south.
I've never been to florida.
Who has n't -- one way or another?
We try to be decent.
You understand perfectly.
I do n't want to talk.
I've come here to arrest you for murder.
To do what?
I ca n't answer that.
What will they do to you?
But even if you were in love with me.
Morning. any calls?
Mr. reed would like you to call him.
All right. get him.
I'm still asking. what do you want?
For five hundred, what do i get?
I go home and paint the kitchen.
For two hundred?
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
You mentioned information.
Got it on you?
Got the information on you?
Get it in half an hour.
Martini.
You, killaine?
And without much discrimination.
Leave that one lay.
What's a buzzer?
So you're not a cop.
I've got good ears.
A private joke.
The usual grind.
Round of golf saturday?
If i can get off.
Yes, i've seen it before.
I do n't.
Well -- good night.
If it does n't take too long. drink?
Thanks. i do n't mind.
I have a warrant for her arrest.
That must hurt.
You'd be breaking the law.
Does n't answer the question.
The only answer i have for you.
That could be told.
Not if she knew she would n't be believed.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. fortunately.
What?
You asked me where it all came from.
Want to walk out ... or get thrown out?
You do n't throw guests out, brandon.
Do n't bet on it. i'm eccentric.
Mr. mitchell.
A little something on account perhaps?
Rather more than a little something, mr. mitchell.
I'm afraid this is all for the moment.
I do n't think you locked your door.
What do you want?
Not a floater. only just dead.
Would you?
You get it's brother.
So it seems sergeant.
Right.
Unless the gun was slanted up.
I guess i'm just ballast around here.
Maybe we've been pretty dumb --
I think so.
Where's the shell?
Should be over there.
You can find out.
Well. what about it?
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
Oh nothing.
Are you always this witty?
Warm water, no doubt.
Positive?
Not quiet yet.
Did you ever have a serious operation?
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
It does. may i go now?
I'll investigate mr. clarendon's financial position --
I do n't understand.
How about magruder?
He checks too.
That leaves two strangers.
So far.
Try betty mayfield. the mitchell case.
Mayfield? she fit into this?
She might.
The card says so, does n't it?
Brandon handled the money envelope.
I hear she's a very pretty girl.
Well, find out. who's covering her?
But you still think she's innocent.
I do.
Two.
What are my orders, sir?
Who's the girl?
Her name's mayfield. betty mayfield.
Nice.
What does it look like?
How long have you had it?
Years, why?
How about your new friend?
I told you she's just..
In an hour, larry.
Thanks.
I think you'll do very well.
We'll see you next week, and if --
Yes.
Sit on that log, dear.
Penfield. james penfield.
Keep me company.
Exactly that.

Of course.
A glamorous young lady way above his station ...
I'll have some of that.
... break away completely from --
And some of that. sorry.
No. i'd want to --
Good.
Yes, please.
Thank you.
That's her.
I think it went on rather too long.
I could n't bear for it to end.
And i did n't like that man.
Oh, but he was terrific.
Who?
I called you a taxi.
Very thoughtful.
Well, you know ...
I have to be up early.
Me too.
I bet. thanks for the drink.
You just might.
Did she talk about me?
Well, you should.
Might?
What did he want?
In your car
Why not.
Oh ... excuse me. there's nicholas.
To the airlift.

Not yet you know any of these people?
To the fleet.
And the argies.

You approve!
Let me see.
We've been playing ten minutes for christ sake.
Far too long.
I'm not sure.
Fuck off.

Why not sit down and wait?
Okay, i will.
Have you come to talk about me?
Not at all. history.

It's been a long time, general.
Someone else will be going in with you.
There's something else, major ...

Where the hell is his body?
There's no sign of it.
He's not really my uncle.
They never are, dear.
Thunder's a horse. come on.

With pride. what can i do for you?
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
Nothing you can say will upset me.
Of course you will.
But what if something happens to you?
Hear this now: i will come for you.
But how can you be sure?
There will never be a need.

At the top of the empire state building --
I think that's what i'm saying.
What?
Look!
About what?
Whatever it is.

Who the hell is jimmy?
He's the only one i told.
That would be me.
What'd you do, piss your pants?
Several possession charges, but nothing major.
Funny, i do n't feel lucky.

It's worth it.
To each, his own.
But you could have gotten killed and i ...
Pass.

I heard.
It seemed appropriate.
You know classical music?

You do n't count.
Those guns are close.

I do n't think that's a good idea.
You could start with an apology.
I did that.
It helped me realize one thing.
What?
You're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother.
It抯 over, cotton.
Not until you抮e dead.
Do i know you? you look familiar.
Tons and tons.
Where is sidney's father?
Home -- where he lives.
And are the police sure about that?
Why do n't you ask them?
Finish what my son started.
But you抣l never get away with it.
Enter cotton weary.
What's your subject?
I was a sorority slut.
Where's sid?
She dumped me.
No way.

Sid, you do n't have to.
The forbidden subject.
I'll get my jacket.
I think it's out of your control.

The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Let's find out.

There's nothing. i'm coming down.
They thought it was a publicity stunt.
Oh my god. how could it happen?
Humor me, sid.
I'll give you one guess.
That's not the way we play the game.
I do n't play games.
What if your life depended on it?
You're pretty when you're angry.
I'm everywhere.
Stay away from the cop.
It's what you want from me.
Watch your back.

Keeping my eye on sidney.

About thirty seconds.

I want to talk to you.
Kenny. camera. now.
Forget it.
I owe you shit.
Have you talked to cotton?
Many times.
Has his story changed?
For attention. the girl has some serious issues.
So who are you?
Your front porch.
That's the original part.
Right here.
Uh-huh.
What am i doing?
Hello sidney.
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy ... again.
Who are you?
Can you knock?
I heard screaming.
No you did n't.
... so call if you need me.
Got it.
Sleep tight, sweetie.
Oooooh ... before or after he sliced and diced.
I thought blockbuster fired you.
Twice.
Do n't shoot. it's me.
Do n't come any closer.
You got it.
Before she dumped him for steve.
We had a run in the mass murder section.
You coming tonight?
Maybe sidney would n't have sex with him.
She's saving herself for you.
It's 1995 -- motives are incidental.
I had'em hid in the foreign section.
He came to make up.
There goes my chance with sid.
Like you had one.
Yeah.
I'll be right back.
No, sid.
Are you kidding? this is like christmas.
Yeah, okay ... whatever.
Cool. see you guys tonight. bring food.
Why are you doing this?
It's all part of the game.
The official term is `` psychotic''.
You'll never get away with this.
What happened?
How do you gut someone?
Yeah, yeah ... are you okay?
Thanks, tatum.
Later.
It's past seven.
Bye.
Just like old times, ai n't it?
No, nothing's like it used to be.
He was there, tatum.
It's alright. i'll get it.
I bet he's pissed.
It was him, tatum. i know it.
Come on. pathos has it's perks.
I did. he's full of shit.
Tits -- see.
How's that?
Thank you.
I'm in.
No, i have n't heard.
There was a second.
Greed. it was written in blood.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
Yeah.
Good.
You know.
I have no understanding of this place anymore.
It's always been like this.
Really?
I read about it in the paper.
What? what?
Where was the prostitute? where was she?
Turn around. hands on your head!
What the hell's going on?
Okay ...
Hello.
It's not too far away now.
Why?
Her pretty head.
No!
You'll see.
A woman ...
Murderers like you?
You should be thanking me.
And, why is that?
It's close.
Shut up!
What the fuck is going on?
Maybe i'm not understanding the question.
I realize that.
For now.
No one yet.
What?
There's a bucket. under the table.
Is there any blood in it?
Guessing at this point is useless.
Can we talk about this in private?
What?
Tonight.
Hello.
What about them?
I read. remember reading?
We put her in a safe house.
Punishing.
Did you read them?
Nothing.
Totally unrelated victims.
I know.
It's got to be.
A switchblade.
We're screwed. he's fucking with us.
Bear with me.
I wish i still thought like you.
Does n't seem like our man, does it?
You tell me. i'm new in town.
Satisfy our curiosity?
Call an ambulance.
Oh, it's alright.
Yes we do. here ...
I do n't know ... like fifty.
Let's go.
I do n't. neither do you.
We're focusing.
The marquis de sade and origins of sadism.
That is.
I'm fine.
What happened?
It was him.
You ca n't go in there.
We have probable cause now.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Think about how we got here!
No point in arguing anymore ...
We had him.
Where's the victory?
When do we get to question him?
Kiss me on the lips.
Give me a break.
Wait!
There's no time to discuss it!
What are you talking about? what happened?
What did you say?
I ca n't let you do this ...
Do n't do this ... please ...
Put the gun down, somerset!
I do n't see anything.
Are you absolutely certain?
I ca n't do this now ... please.
What?
Too long. what do you think so far?
I do n't sleep very well.
I do n't know ...
I do n't know.
How should i know?
But mose harper said ...
Why do n't you finish the job?

He just could n't wait ...

Not likely.
We wo n't be here ... come on!
What's goin' on?
Not far from it ...
Do n't go blamin' yourself ...
You've seen her! ... she's alive?
I've seen her ... and she's alive.

Oh god, tommi ...

It still worked in town.
I mean the armchair!
Oh, damnit!
Do you have a better idea?
I'll do it myself.
You?
My father was an electrician. already forgot that?
I just had a really strange experience.
Cherry-red tears.
What?
So do i, believe me.
Someone from the village.
Yeah ... i have to go to town.
In the village. look what i found.
I have n't the slightest idea.
Hi, darling.
I would n't have made it by myself.
You do n't remember?
Does this dog here belong to you?
Village gossip. you're a real attraction here.
I've killed my husband!
What?
We should leave the past alone.
Yes, something was ...
Very funny.
Mercutio
It's good.
Oh
The title wo n't do.
Ah
Romeo and juliet -- just a suggestion.
Thank you, ned.
Right you are, governor!
Yes.
I had the christopher marlowe in my boat once.
Sir robert de lesseps.
Lady?
My massacre at paris is complete.
You have the last act?

Tomorrow.
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
Wait! will you desist!
Twenty pounds on delivery

Ask him.
No juliet?!
See you in jail.
Romeo. wit, swordsman, lover.
The title?
Romeo
I will play him. bring it tomorrow.
It's for henslowe. he paid me.
How much?
Ten pounds.
You're a liar.
Nothing comes.
Most interesting.
A goodly length in times past, but lately
No, no. you have a wife, children
No, your marriage bed.
Yet can not love nor write it.
Who is that?
Yes, i saw it.
Put his feet in.
It's a comedy.
Cut his nose off.
A new comedy. by will shakespeare!
And his ears.
Romeo and ethel the pirate's daughter.
Good title.
There's never any
Of course not!
What have i done, mr. fennyman?
The theatres are all closed by the plague!
Oh, that.
By order of the master of the revels!
I do n't know. it's a mystery.
Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
Very well.
But nothing is happening.
Yes, but very well.
Nobody knew!
It will be all right, madam.
What happened to sam?
Who are you?
Thomas kent!
Every word.
God be praised! locked?
As soon as i have found my muse
She is always aphrodite.
Fifty pounds? what for?
To my weekly confession.
To the palace at whitehall.
Is it about a pirate's daughter?
What? who?
Romeo.
The one who came with your letter?
What?
No, it will turn out well.
How will it?
I do n't know, it's a mystery.
What do we do now?
The show must � you know
Go on.
I do n't know. it's a mystery.
How goes it, will?
Wonderful, wonderful.
Burbage says you have a play.
I have. and chinks to show for it.
And yours?
Yes, that's good. until he meets
Ethel.
Do you think?
The daughter of his enemy.
The daughter of his enemy.
I thought your play was for burbage.
This is a different one.
A different one you have n't written?
`` is the day so young?''
`` of love?''
Lady viola is pious, my lord.
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
Will you ask her majesty to be patient?!
I will.
But at the playhouse. nurse?
Be still.
I am not so well-born.
Stand up straight, girl.
What do you love so much?
Your majesty
And i love poetry above all.
Above lord wessex?
I have lost my gift.
Burbage has my keeping but you have my heart.
But your voice have they dropped?
`` she speaks.
I have, master shakespeare.
But the plague
Who is there?
Will shakespeare!
Oh but why `` alas?''
If they find you here they will kill you.
You can bring them with a word.
Oh, not for the world!
Can you love a player?
Then kiss me again for i am not mistook.
It is strange to me, too.
Even your play.
Oh
And that was only my first try.
Well perhaps better than my first.
I must. look -- how pale the window.
Moonlight!
No, the morning rooster woke me.
It was the owl -- come to bed
Mr. henslowe?
Let him be damned for his pages!
Oh -- no, no!
There is time. it is still dark.
I must. i must
Oh, but it is mine too!
You can not, wessex will kill you
I know how to fight!
A literary feud. quite normal.
Oh, my love you ran from me before.
How does it?
I do n't know. it's a mystery
My lord.
I have spoken with your father.
Lord wessex. you have been waiting.
It was your eyes. no, your lips.
The queen has consented?
Bless me, i thought it was a horse.
I am going to church.
My hat?
Where did you learn how to do that?
I...
Wait there.
Are you mr. shakespeare?
Let me see you. take off your hat.
Do you understand me?
No, sir.
It is only ours you can know.
She loves me, thomas!
Does she say so?
Are you bringing your laundry woman?
A man, my lord?
By god, i'll fight the lot of you
I do n't know -- campbell or something?
I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
I was trying to educate you.
Just serve.
In the same fashion as chess.
What?
Chess. chess is often used as well.
Will you shut up and play.
You're a bad loser.
I have n't lost yet.
Discussion group, alex, discussion.
About what?
About this guy, this hugo person.
I do n't have time.
I'm only asking what you think.
Why, thank you, david.
Alex, i do n't have the time --
Think about it.
No.
Come on, david.
No.
Juliet?
He could n't get his car started.
When are you going to let the police know?
You call them if you want.
And what about you?
Dig the pit, i do n't know.
No, not that.
Then what? who's going to do what?
You know what i'm talking about.
I do n't hear this.
I wo n't be able to.
Take his legs.
But not quite.
Is that going to be deep enough?
Is this necessary?
Yes. now come on, all or nothing.
Can we talk about something?
Not now. i have an idea.
I want to talk now.
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
Now.
After.
I do n't know.
How much did you pay?
I do n't know.
How much?
I do n't know.
Security.
From what? jehovah's witnesses?
There was a break-in.
You're sure? there's lots more.
Nothing.
You're not eating.
Not eating what?
Looking for you? yes.
Your friends.
I do n't know what you're talking about.
Well?
But there's no --
Do n't know what?
This is just an informal discussion.
Are you recording it?
What does it look like?
It looks like he's writing everything down.
Well, then?
I've never seen any of these men before.
Take another look at these two.
I do n't know them.
What?
Parked outside?
That's all?
Sorry to waste your time.
Oh, no problems. do n't worry.
Just one thing.
Yes.
What?
Yes, thanks.
Good. well, you've seen the flat?
Yes.
And you like it?
Oh, yes, it's great.
Nothing. we thought you were someone else.
Cameron?
Yes.
Really?
Just serve.
Well, she had problems --
Alex.
Not usually this drunk.
-- instead of what he is --
What i am.
-- which is --
-- which is a hack.
The man we know and love.
Yeah.
I think you're lying.
You're right.
You see, they do n't really know me.
No. any idea which channel he's on?
So i gathered.
Maybe he did n't like us.
David?
Hugo.
His car's still there.
He's got a car?
So what's wrong with that?
What sort of car?
Open it.
You want me to kick it open?
Yes.
Now?
Yes.
All right. no problem.
Did what?
What? what's wrong?
What are you doing?
I'm just looking.
Do n't.
Do n't look?
No.
What?
Is that all?
I thought we all were.
And now you tell me.
David?
I want my money back. excuse me.
For ever and ever.
Who?
Cameron. you remember cameron.
No, i do n't.
What's he doing here?
That's not him.
You were magnificent.
Who was it?
No.
Then let's spend some money.
Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
No, no, it's different.
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
It tastes different.
You know we're right.
Do n't you?
He ca n't stay up there.
He'll come down. leave him alone.
What are you doing here?
We have to talk.
Your painful groin?
David?
Exactly. now i've been thinking --
Oh, good.
We could put it somewhere.
Where he ca n't get it?
Now you thought of that, not me.
Forget it -- he'll come down.
No.
Oh.
Well, i'm not expecting anyone either.
I refuse.
You're frightened.
I'll wait there.
What?
That's what i thought he said.
The perfect couple, i should say.
You must n't take it so badly.
No.
I see.
What?
What?
You were going to say something.
You mean i can have the room?
Yeah.
It's about the burglary.
Burglary?
Downstairs.
Of course.
Can we come in?
Who said there were four?
Yeah, that's right, that's it.
You're sure of that.
Yes.
That was n't a question.
Do you smoke?
Yes.
No.
Yes. they're my friends.
Two hundred pounds?
Two hundred pounds.
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
That's what it cost, david.
What?
Were you expecting anyone? tonight?
No.
Who have you talked to?
No one.
If i think you're lying --
With a face like this?
I should hope so.
It was on the television.
You and me?
And you need your sleep.
Sorry?
Here.
Right here?
In this firm.
Exactly what i was --
I'm not sure --
You get the job done.
Oh, i see, i thought you meant --
What happened to that guy?
What guy?
That guy, the one that died.
That one, last week.
Here?.
Yeah, here, i mean, where else?
Oh, him. well, he died.
That's what i thought.
You must be juliet.
Would you like to come in?
I'd be delighted.
Would you like to see the rest?
A priest who dies.
I see.
Yeah. well, maybe i'll change it.
No.
It's a breeze.
The telephone? it continues to ring.
All right.
Did he sound upset?
A little bit. is that good or bad?
It's an improvement.
I'm a doctor.
And he's a patient of yours?
No. but he needs treatment.
For what?
A certain weakness.
The human condition.
You know about it?
I write about it?
And that's not the same thing?
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
Diseases.
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
I suppose so.
I mean, that's what it's like.
Sorry?
It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
One other thing. do you have any tattoos?
Is it real?
Or a fake?
Chicken salad, devra!
Yeah, baby, how's it going?
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
No.
No, it's a very groovy girl.
Then what's the problem?
Who?
That kid ... the hairdresser.
What?
That you were just indulging me.
What do you expect me to do about it?
I just thought you'd like to know --
Yes, sweetheart, shh.
That's okay too.
My keys.
I thought you said you were n't going anywhere.
Listen, baby, do n't leave, really.
Why not?
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
Yeah, i think so.
That's very serious. who's her doctor?
I do n't know.
Gee, that's very serious ...
I know.
She did?
It turned out to be cancer.
Wow.
I do n't want to see you anymore.
I'll be right back, baby, really.
I got ta talk to you.
I do n't want to talk about it ...
But you do n't know what happened.
I do n't care.
What?
I'll have mary wash you. mary!
What kind of treatment?
You're looking great, baby.
What're you doing later?
Whatever you say.
Your husband?
Yes.
What about?
I do n't know. just a minute ...
I hope she's all right.
No, i know.
And i certainly would n't tell lester.
I know.
I mean it or i would n't say it.
Hello, george.
Right now, i just do n't care.
She what?
She's a friend of jill's.
And who's jill?
... what? ...
That headboard.
Nobody can hear it.
Uh-uh.
Let it ring.
No.
Are you in love with her?
Her?
Are you?
No.
Then it's not your problem.
It is n't?
No. you know too many sick ladies.
I guess so.
God, i adore you.
Hello.
Yeah.
A little.
You're my mother's hairdresser?
I do her hair, yeah.
Chopped liver?
No thanks.

Making it with my mother?
Why?

Do n't make conversation with me.
What?
I never get my hair done.
No kidding.
You think that's funny, do n't you?
Yeah.
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
Yeah ...
Then what do you think?
That you're just like your mother.
I am not like my mother!
You are.
I am not!
You are.
Look ... do you wan na fuck me?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.

Great.
Wonderful woman.
She is.

Well, i do.
Probably the bathroom.

I'd cut it ...
You would?
Yeah, i think so ...
You do n't seem very sure.
No, i'm sure.
Great.
She's incredible ... she loves you, george.
Yeah ... i mean great.
Whew.
What's wrong?
It's hot in here.
Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
The shrink? many times.
Do you? you still see him?
Why not?
And what?
Did you?
I just have to do one little thing.
What?
Did you?
Did i what?
You know what i'm talking about.
Hey, i do n't tell.
Well, did you or did n't you?
You did, i know you did.
One of my few virtues is discretion.
Yeah, baby ...
You're a genius.
I do n't want to ... i swear ...
What are you talking about?
Sit down!
-- this guy with jill.
He's a director.
Jackie, can we --
Fuckin' a --

Oh, i can think of a million things-
Sssh. sweet sue.
No. it's nice and cozy.
Anything wrong?
No, no.
And your head is hot.
That's ridiculous.
And you've got cold feet.
Is n't that ridiculous?
I'm a very sick girl.
Maybe i'd better go before i catch something.
I'm not that sick.
I have a very low resistance.
I'm fine.
How's the bottle?
Half-full.
Uh-uh. not yet.
When?
We better have a drink first.
Here. this'll put hair on your chest.
No fair guessing.
We have some bourbon- lets make manhattans.
I'm just going to get some ice.
Thank you, daphne.
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
But there's one thing i envy you for.
What's that?
Or was it bryn mawr?
Oh yes, we do!
I guess she's not in here.
Do you suppose she went out shopping?
Yes.
You like it?
I always did.
Oh- here and there- and around.
I thought you said three years.
What's the big idea?
The florida job?
You're the wrong shape. goodbye.
- you got to be blonde-
We could dye our hair.
- and you got to be girls.
We could-
Help yourself.
I am osgood fielding the third.
I am cinderella the second.
Let me carry one of the instruments.
Thank you. are n't you a sweetheart?
You must be quite a girl.
Wan na bet?
She does n't approve of girls who smoke.
Goodbye?
This is where i get off.
Oh, you do n't get off that easy.
No, thank you. i'll walk.
About that roadhouse-
Yes, osgood?
You're leading again.
Sorry.
Come one!
Flower girl.
And i smoke. i smoke all the time.
I do n't care.
And i can never have children.
We'll adopt some.
You ai n't going nowhere.
We wo n't breathe a word.
It's three weeks in florida-
Because i got some plans-
Yes, joe.
What kind of band is this, anyway?
You got to be under twenty-five-
William morris!
You two from the poliakoff agency?
Yes, we're the new girls.
On the baltimore and ohio.
Oh.
I play the ukulele. and i sing too.
I would n't say that. careless, maybe.
Have you ever been with a male band?
Me?
I'll say.
You ca n't trust those guys.
Every time!
You know- i play tenor sax.
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
Yeah.
Maybe you'll meet one too, josephine.
Glasses?
Search me. i mean- i'll see.
Would you mind terribly?
Not at all.
Good night, sugar.
Just my feminine intuition.
My fault.
You're not hurt, are you?
I do n't think so.
I wish you'd make sure.
Why?
Who are you?
Now, really-
Not very likely.
Are you staying at the hotel?
Not at all.
Your face is familiar.
And who mixes the cocktails- your wife?
Well, i'm not.
That's very interesting.
Up, up, up.
No- the ukulele. and i sing.
For your own amusement?
- opening of the opera-
- riding to hounds-
- and always the same four hundred.
Please- no names. just call me junior.
It's been delightful meeting you both.
And you will come to hear us tonight?
If it's at all possible-
Oh, i did n't hear you come in.
What?
Guess!
They repealed prohibition?
I am?
Three?
Yes- that's our hurricane cellar.
It's all right for a bachelor.
What a beautiful fish.
Caught him off cape hatteras.
What is it?
Oh- a member of the herring family.
I do n't mind if i do.
Down the hatch- as we say at sea.
Bon voyage.
It's the crews' night off.
You mean we're alone on the boat?
Completely.
They just sort of leave me cold.
You mean- like frigid?
Have i? i'm trying all the time.
Nothing at all?
Complete washout.
That makes me feel just awful.
I do n't want to bore you.
Oh, you could n't possibly.
Is it that hopeless?
Why?
Thanks just the same.
What is it?
I'm afraid not. terribly sorry.
So inhale!
I'm not quite sure. try it again.
Thank you.
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
Good morning.
Let's make it an even million.
From a rich millionaire.
That's wonderful. poor josephine.
Me?
I told you- i'm not very bright.
I come to the old lady's funeral.
Please!
Booze.
Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
Coffee?
Some people got no respect for the dead.
Embalming people with coffee- eighty-six proof.
Me? i'm just a customer here.
We got different information.
From who? toothpick charlie, maybe?
Toothpick charlie? never heard of him.
You shave with your spats on?
I sleep with my spats on.
Yes, sir.
And who runs it?

They are awaiting further information.
The device has stopped responding.
My ... wings ...

It's steady, good benefits.
That's very pragmatic of you, barnes.
Thank you.
Well, maybe i'll surprise you.
I can hardly wait.

That's very professional sounding of you, taylor.
Taylor, you surprise me.
Good help is hard to find ...
That's me.
I know, i know.
That's clear.
Over and out!
Yeah, i guess money do n't buy class.
Will you shut up already?
Just do n't move around too much.
I'm sure you'll be all right.
I do n't know.
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
Well maybe we can do something like that.
Seen one like it before?
Great.
Suppose you did n't have to hold your breath?
Close every door behind you!
Wait.
I understand.
Ready as i'll ever be.
So we did.
At this point i'm ready for anything.
Yeah?
Sure.
A flare? a flare wo n't do it.
No ...

Taylor! where are you?
Barnes?
So what's going to happen to you?
Sooner than later.
Over and out.

And so far.
Marry you?
That's right. will you marry me?
I do n't know. wave to them!
Congratulations on your ... recent award.
Thank you.
Is there anything i can help you with?
No, just enjoying the view.
He's in the bathroom.
Are you nuts! it's too risky!
Homesick? it's only been two days!
How am i supposed to know?
The engines!
Mac. what's shaking?
I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
That's affirmative.
I'm from akron.
What kind of man?
A bowler.
Nope.
You have orange whips?
It belonged to my dad.
What do you want with old man faz?
Lem me see your ball.
When you get a chance.
We're looking for buzz fazeli, seen him?
I hate fuckin' opera.
No kiddin'.
Wait! that's an aria!

See ya'round faz.
Theo's bowled on the tour.
Wish me luck.
Theo.
Need some advice, huh.
100 years!
It's mine.
Who gave it to you?
Grace skinner.
Grace skinner. who's grace skinner to you?
She's my mom.
You knew her. you married her in 1963.
I ai n't nobody's father!
What's it look like to you?
It looks like dwarf bowling.
You wish!
No ...
I did n't think so.
He says that to all his wives.
I am underground.
Hello, mom?
Theodore? where are you? are you alright?
I found dad.
Cool!
Who's there?
Buzz fazeli.
No, junior, you should n't touch her.
Who's there?
Junior.
Junior who?
Someone wants to play with me?
Look who's talking!
Leave him alone!
You still got the touch junior.
Bowling `` center''!
Line up where you want it.
Yeah.
Now swing it out a little to the right ...
Like this?
Who wants to know? zeus!
I'm a bowler.
They suspended me.
I'm sorry about zeus, millie.
He's my father, millie.
He's no father to you.
The peter pan.
Whips ... orange whips.
Uh ... over easy.
Coming right up.
Mine, and they never tip.
Business.
Wo n't your father help you with that?
Where did your brother escape from?
The mental hospital.
What does he do?
It's a vicious cycle.
No, not at all.
Can i ask you something personal?
I'd rather you did n't.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Not while i'm in training.
Do you have a boyfriend?
No. do you?
No. not at the present.
So, what about you?
Do i want you?
We'll get into that later.
Why were you suspended?
What's plan b?
Plan b is your dad.
Come on theo, what about plan c?
What's plan c?
Plan c ... ... is me.
More than you could afford.
Come on, bargain with me.
I could let them go for ten.
You're here.
Too late for what, sheila?
Why not?
It's junior, is n't it.
It?
Tell me what happened theo.
I feel sick.
You should.
Are you sure he's dead?
I did n't stop to take his pulse.
At least i'll die smiling.
Fuck plan c!
Suck my dick!
I am a professional man.
Lips still for sale?
I'm not here to bowl.
Tell your little pal to let go.
Breeze, give him his ball back!
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
Who identified the body?
Let me out, captain. open the door!
Please, dr. levine.
Open it, captain!
Dr. levine, please! return to your seat!
They're like pink snow, sir. sticky.
It's burning ...
Get out of there!
I ca n't see ...
Fletcher! now!
I ca n't ...
Back away then.
Wait a minute --
I said back away.
Would you wait a minute?
What is it?
Edmunds, do you have a 20 on norman?
Two and a half days?
But she's --
Nobody move!
What was that?
Fifty yards and closing.
What do we use for defense?
But you've tested it?
He's right beneath us.
That's our reserve air.
It's either that or we grow gills.
Do you see it?
Now!
Pull it, damn it!
Captain.
Captain. right, forgive me.
What team?
Nothing else.
Press? no, i have n't.
Storm? what storm?
A thousand feet.
Then why am i here?
What?
What do you need me for?
-- dating the crash at least that old.
Hold on --
Maybe older --
It's impossible.
What's wrong with oxygen?
Take a look.
What?
Everything can be killed.
What do you mean, he's missing?
You do n't want to know.
I think i do.
-- and then brought her down here --
Because if jerry is powerful and also emotional ...
Damn it, edmunds?
Jerry?
Jerry? please. stop this.
Pull it.
Working on it now, sir.
They're coming.
Nothing, sir.
Fuck him. what? hello?
What the hell is going on here?
Well, where the fuck is he?
In the ship, sir.
If the subs are n't here yet, sir --
To the craft? none. not a scratch.
Then how can it be chipped?
Yes, harry.
Ted seems to have some ideas.
Ladies and gentlemen ...
Who is that? where's that coming from?
Please watch your closest monitor ...
I have to tell you. it's strange.
How do you mean, strange?
It's not ignorant.
She wired this system.
What are you going to do -- shoot her?
What is it?
Radiation shield, you think?
What do you make of this?
Sir, about leaving --
To what?
Internal power.
What's inside the sphere.
The sensors are picking up something outside.
What?
Resetting the sub.
What sub?
That's quite a secret.
Wait -- down where?
To the spacecraft. to investigate.
Underwater?
No. go ahead. really. ladies first.
Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless.
Get this thing off me.
The library.
We have a library?
Yeah, it was awful.
What about you? what happened to you?
What?
And you did n't tell anyone?
Beth --
What are they?
Eggs.
In edmunds' things.
You went through edmunds' things?
Do n't tell me to calm down!
What?
You told him about me?
You did, did n't you?
Do n't do this.
You bastard.
Beth --
I have to reset the sub.
Do n't bother me, norman.
It's not worth the risk.
You, me and harry. he's asleep.
Why should i go?
I do n't trust harry to do it.
I would. but my suit --
I fixed your suit.
You do n't trust me?
But i do n't know how --
You fixed this suit? beth?
Still clear.
I think so, beth. yes.
Fixing it.
The refridgerator.
We must've had it delivered then.
Wait a second --
None of this was here before.
You do n't believe me.
All i know is i opened that refridgerator --
What?
What?
I do n't know.
How can the sphere do that?
Why would harry go back to using a code?
Something for burns.
Ulcers.
Tranquilizer. causes drowsiness.
Bingo.
Antihistamine. for bites.
Antibiotic.
Parasolutrine?
How do you spell it?
It's a soporific.
What's that?
Causes sleep.
It's like a sleeping pill?
Three to six hours.
I'll just boost the doses.
What? wait -- is n't that dangerous?
How fast does it take effect?
Does n't say.
Beth --
To be on the safe side. i mean --
You want to kill him?
For what?
Not believing you.
Where are you?
In the sub. resetting the timer. why?
What do you mean, different?
Your watch.
Oh yes, my watch. i almost forgot.
I'm feeling better.
Are you?
You think i'd really drink that?
Snakes? what do you mean, exactly?
You know what i mean.
Do you fear them?
Do n't you?
Are you manifesting them?
He ca n't manifest.
No, he ca n't.
Someone did.
C'mon -- what?
You're lying --
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
You manifested that, beth.
Is it?
But i have to, norman.
I promise --
Promise what, norman? tell me!
Beth --
It's either this ... or i kill you.
You're frightened, are n't you, norman?
Do n't you know?
Leave me alone, norman.
Top shelf, is it?
What?
You hear that?
Hear what?
Get away from me!
Beth --
Get away --
What's that -- mistake number two, norman?
It does n't make any sense.
By the bunks.
Who says it's a he?
For whoever's in that thing.
It's an american spacecraft.
In time for what?
What?
Just in time for what?
Like what? i'm not --
You're staring at me.
No i'm not. i'm not star --
Yes you are ...
What?
You holding up alright?
Fine. i'm fine.
Do n't be defensive.
I'm not being defensive.
You sound defensive.
I'm fine.
No, why do n't --
Wait a second, i --
Look, would you --
Whatever i can do to help.
To what?
Time travel. a black hole.
Which one? let me get the list out.
Gim me another explanation.
No. i did n't say that.
Then what, norman?
What noise?
It's like ...
What are you still doing here?
You remember opening the door?
Then explain it to me.
What is it, harry?
You do n't remember that?
Harry?
Norman, where are you?
I ca n't breathe ... am i ... clear?
You're clear. you see the airlock?
What do you mean? she's not here?
When i woke up, nobody was here.
Beth left?
I thought she was with you.
You did n't say that about the food?
Wisconsin?
Navy transmission. they're sent from wisconsin.
How do we decode it?
That's right.
You know what it is, harry.
Stop what? what are you --?
I do n't think so.
Help me lift her.
Shut up and open the door.
Hold on.
Are you trying, damn it? just --
Hurry, norman. four minutes.
I heard! i heard!
Shut up and catch.
I'm trying to keep balance with --
Gim me a second --
You got her?
No idea.
Well, press something!
Wait!
What is it, harry?
Just one of norman's many secrets.
That's right.
Is it?
Think about it.
If it is an alien spacecraft --
Meaning it did n't land in the water.
Please. it must have flown here --
`` we are friends''.
Thank you.
Does this mean what i think it means?
The others, sir?
Beth and harry?
They're in the sub, sir. waiting.
Just that. careful, it's heavy.
No, they did n't say --
This way, sir.
You mean they have n't told you yet?
Told me what?
You've heard of me?
Huh?
What report?
You mean you do n't know?
Know what?
Geologists? at a plane crash?
He's a pussy.
Squint harder.
Please, ted.
Try this one.
This is like nursery school.
Unless it's an act.
Not that i know of. why?
You seen my suitcase?
What?
Was it a military crash?
I do n't know.
They never used to send a navy car.
I'm not afraid of anything ...
Oh, so you're a warrior then?
Of course. i'm a bendu officer.
You saw through me?
You could put it that way.
I assure you my intentions were n't bad.
They use the bogan force.
He ca n't find organa major.
Try to feel it. use the force ...
You look great! the uniform and everything!
Yes, sir.
Have you been checked out?
What's that?
Forget it, son.
I'll make a report later.
Was this trip really necessary?
It's automatic.
What are you saying?
Why did n't you say so before.
I think i did.
Come back here ... where are you going?
No need, everything's under control.
With four casualties?!
He'll be well cared for.
I read you sir.
Are you there, sir? we're going ...
You rich kids ... are all the same!
Whad'ya talkin about?
Death to all bugs!
Not enough, i guess.
Others are waiting.
You got it bad.
Ace of spades.
I got games& theory.
I'm getting better.
Do n't you have to finish the game?
They revoke our flight status.
Oh, i see ... teamwork.
Well, whad'ya know ...
There! gravity field ... it's big!
It looks like an ... asteroid.
So who's got time to get married?
I'm not kidding. marriage is-
Excuse me ...!
A funeral.
How do you feel about him now?
I do n't know, zander.
I do.
Your turn ...
Who?
Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.
It's all i think about anymore.
Why not?
I thought you were going to help carl.
Carl can wait.
Johnny, my dad's home today.
How do i know if this is love?
I'll meet you outside.
Good luck at the academy.
You two have so much in common.
I ca n't help it.
He's nothing like you.
Who cares?
You're right. let's never stop ...
Shhh ...
Did you get starside r& d?
I'll miss you, too, johnny.

It's not bad.
How old are you?
Thirty-five.
How much do you weigh?

Can you really see through anything?
Uh-huh.

Ally. that's right.
How are you?
And what does he do again?
How is mrs. stephens?
We're ... not together.
I'd heard that. but she's well?
Yes ... fine.
And zoe? how's zoe?

It turns to steaming piss.
That's okay.
Alison.
Say hi to zoe.
I will.
I hope she gets better.
I'll tell her that.

Why?
I do n't know.
I'm not sure.
Oh. right.
Goodnight, nicole.
The children.
She's resting. in her room.
Say hello for me.
Because it's what we have to do.
A while.

When the game's over, i guess.
It's natural.
Your kids never cry.

Do you know where the adagio begins?
Of course.
I do n't buy that.
It's the truth.

Your guess is as good as mine.
I was n't told. i just knew it.
How?
I was warned.

Conscientious, determined, dogged.
They said i was dogged?

You know your weapons, buddy.

Great.
You're a big help.
Alright, the beige one.
I hate the beige one.

Pain can be controlled. you disconnect it.
And so you feel nothing.
It's better that way.

Kyle ...
Ticklish?
You'll beg for mercy in a second.
You're not supposed to.
We did it, kyle. we got it.

Clean out your locker.
Please, do n't do that ...
Oh, no ... you.
Do n't explain. fuck off. goodbye.
I do n't know ... he fell.
I do n't think he's breathing.
Do n't just stand there, get help!
This ca n't be real ...
He's turning blue!
What ... is ... happening ...?
You should be.
Where are you going?
Home.
How do you know that's the way?
How thoughtful. the gift of inconvenience.
Why not?
You first.
Please ...

Nicholas ...
Get us out!
It was n't you. it was n't personal ...
You call them ...

Why would you say that?
It does n't matter ...

A game?
It's different every time.
Humor me with specifics.
We provide whatever's lacking.

But there's a sad catch to the story.
That smell ... oh, god.

I got more scared.
It was a stupid thing to do.

Not for you, clearly.
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
Am i a thing?
Well, you're certainly not a person.
I'm not.
It's not a knock.
It's not a compliment.
What kind of food?

Why?
I'm not into finger foods. too fussy.
Like you.
Oh, god.
I'm sorry.
Italian.
Who?
Not who, food. should we get italian.

Better today than tomorrow.
How dare you stop me doing god's will!
They've started the battle without me!
Well ...
Come with me ...
Jeanne, no ...
What ... what do you mean?
You make it sound so simple ...
Tell the king to give me more men.
To be killed in battle?
It would not be the same without you.
Not yet!
Do as i say!
I want to stay with you ...
That's an order!
I -- i do n't understand ...
One day you will.
Good.
We have to press home the attack!
Sound the retreat ...
But i promised jeanne we'd fight on!

It was on a sunday, was n't it?
I do n't remember. maybe.

Is it here? now? in this room?
You have nothing to regret ...
Thanks be to god.

What's the use? the drawbridge is up!
Not for long ...
Jeanne ... get up ... this is ridiculous ...
If you kill him, you kill me!
Who gave you that horse?
My king.
How many did he give you?
Playing ...
I -- i -- i ...
I might ask you the same question.
Yes!
Who?
Because ... i have to be alone!

Why would they?
Yes ... lots of things!
Really?
No, i ...
Are you going to leave me too?
Are you willing to follow all his commandments?
Yes ...
Yes, my lord.
Let's see.
But you already confessed this morning ...
I need to confess again.
My father's.
I'm sure he'll forgive you.
And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
Oh yes, she's ... wonderful.
Yes, it is.
Then ... why are you here so often?
He never says his name.
What ... does he ... look like?
And what does he say to you?
Only god knows the answer to that.

It was just an idea.
Four grand.
But you do n't have the money?
We're two thousand short.
That's tough.
The sick boy method.
Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.
He knows a lot about sean connery.
That's hardly a substitute.
You'll need one more hit.

Life is not a dream.
Go to sleep, spock.

You would n't be here otherwise.
Are you jorge?
Leave him alone.
Do you intend to stay here for some time?
She's left.
Is she coming back?
No.
Why?
Then let him go and he'll follow you.
And let him get run over by somebody else?
They told me it is n't at the hospital.
Things seem to be getting better.
Stop this!
He's lying through his ass!
Is anything the matter, mr. mayor?
You can not leave ...
Why not?
There's been an accident.

Whatever you want.
What do you want me to do?
Most places are, jimmy.
My new bike.
Very funny.
You want it in writing?
Just a formality.
I meant biologically.
That's a crappy thing to say.
In what sense?
Me?
Interesting.
You never know around here.
Funny you should say `` peachy.''
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
Why ca n't you be nice to me?
You've got enough people kissing your ass.
To the best hiding place in the world.
Whatever.
He phoned it in.

I doubt it.
I mean my father.
It's incredibly simple.
And then what?
I know.
Well? where the hell are you?
He's on the move?

I'm very aural.
Tell me more.
Not a chance.
Come on.
Maybe someday.
But absolutely true.
You think you're working with chimps here?
Yellow pages?
Let your fingers do the walking.

She's going to wash your jeep?
Thanks.
I was thinking, antigua, maybe.
The teeth doin' any talkin'?
I'm fine. nice tv.
Were n't you a little worried about her ...?
Ray thinks she was murdered.
You could tell me where you were last night.
Back to the land of grownups.
Lombardo's settlement?
You could say that.
Just check out the car.
Where's the body?
We do n't know that, ray ...
Ray, you heard him ...
Yeah, maybe, a little.
Why is that?
He dropped jimmy off first?
Yeah.
So you were alone.
Yes.
Did he come in with you?
I guess.
What was that?
You know what that will mean for lombardo.
Yeah ... okay ... he did
I said he did.
I'm sorry?
A ride. you want one?
Yeah. but i got my bike.
You and suzie used to come out here together?
You are.
Nothing.

Shit.
Curiosity, i guess.

I'm not on your property!
Hi, mon.

Yes. god, mom ...
Where, the mall?
A friend of mine bought a boat.
I wo n't.
In back of the garage.
Rules are rules, mr. lombardo.
So you got my mom's money.
About six and a half million dollars.
We have to stick with the plan.
Stick?
Yes.
Hello.
God, i've been calling you.
That's not your line.
Say you love me.
I love you. now give me the line.
No little girl can ever make me come.
You think that's wise?
Fair enough. let's go make a statement.
You ca n't ...
I did. at blue balls.
Will they?
It does n't look like it.
Then he'll be back at blue balls?
That's right. that was his name.
The one you bought at school.
Yes.
And she wanted to talk.
Yes.
That's right.
Put kelly on too.
That was the same thing ray said.
Fuck the winch. i wan na drive.

A cylinder recorder. my own design.
Shhh! come on. tell us something!
It's better than nothing.
It is?
Sounds like a train. looks like a train.
Yes. and a much nicer one than ours.
It's not a guy ...
It's a town!
Relax. we're almost there.
I adjusted it.
Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
My pleasure.
I know! i know!
Of course not.
Thank you.
Where have you been?
My lord, he was telling the truth!
But it only has six legs.
We'll see.
You tell me.
Would that include me?

Home.
You could n't wait until morning?
I was wrong.
But why?
Only the elders.
How long?

How long have i been here?
Two days.
You tell him. when you're able.
Buttons are hochmut.
Hochmut?
But stoltzfus said ...
I know what he said.
Oh. the bullets.
We had some lemonade and he left.
A real fireball.
But ... you may not be well enough.
I'll drink some more of stoltzfus' tea.
Not long ... a few days.
I was being foolish?
Are n't you? after today?
That's god's way!
Here. whenever you want them.
I did n't even know about it.
Johnny! where the hell have you been?
I hear you. i'll stay in touch.
Say again?
Wrong.
You'd lie to protect him.
Probably.
I admit i do n't know where he is.
You're the first one he'll contact.
He's got my number.
Not yet.
But ... if you had to guess?
Yes, thank you very much.
John said you're amish.

Elektra king.
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
I was hoping you could tell me.
Elektra would control it all.
We go down to the torpedo bay.
He抯 going to insert the plutonium.
Like riding a bike.
Just wanted to put him on edge ...
Count to twenty. i抣l be there.
We can抰.
James. it wouldn抰 really be ...
Perhaps after this ... test?
... yes? ...
I could come for a second opinion?
Quite the opposite, in fact.
I took the initiative.
You haven抰 been given an assignment in this case.
I was the one who brought that money in ...
Renard.
Now robert is dead. he got his revenge.
Is maybe ... the inside woman.
Your last chance. give me the name.
Indeed.
Consider me ungrateful.
Haven抰 you heard the news? so is she.

Partially, yes.
Since the kidnapping. why do you ask?

I have to go.
Then take me with you.

I don抰 want to be safe!
I have to go to work.
Two. shaken not stirred.
Not at that price. time to surrender.
I don抰 know what you抮e talking about!
I think you do.
Not interested.
Soon she抣l be everywhere.
Five more turns and your neck will break.
Just like you ... only you were even easier.
It is my oil! mine and my family抯!
Oh james.
You, of course. i need some information.
I thought you were the one in her business.
A rope!
No! get me out!
Istanbul.
How appropriate.
Bond!
Could ... could you come?
Please.
Who? bond? bond is dead.
Is it?
How would you know?
What do you think?
Yes. au revoir ...
It抯 heading for the oil terminal.
Where it can do the most damage.
Still no contact yet.
Please.
You oughta see upstairs. it's a slaughterhouse.
No idea who's behind this?
Do n't call me that.
Who is she? do you know her?
We do n't know that.
Hello, adrian.
What's your theory?
Jon! get back! you do n't understand.
Mm hmm.
I could stay and go.
Cured, yes.
Jon -- what??
The south pole. time箂 flowing backwards.
I could n't let him interfere with my project.
I筸 not.
What if you箁e wrong??
Damn straight! we were heroes.
His... whatever.
Pick a record. i feel like dancing.
Do n't look. turn around.
All right. mission accomplished.
That detroit shit? i'm so worried.
The costumes. am i right?
I think he's going to the john.
Where did he go?
Everything's changed --
Did anybody follow you? see you come here?
What do you mean, frame-up?
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
I do n't think she's coming with us.
Shut up, rorschach.
Nothing. what were you going to say?
-- what?
No. we laid out very careful ground rules --
Did you know he was back on the streets?
I do n't know their real names.
You're lying, miss juspeczyk.
I do n't know their real names!
What does this mean? what does it --
Am i free to go?
Laurie! good to see you.
And how's life with the walking h-bomb?
I'll take a raincheck, laurie.
Please.
I'm sorry about blake.
Ever see one of these before?
The name's gibbons. you were saying?
What is this place?
Looks like a diner.
Just remember, i'll be watching.
But programmable. and expendable.
I've seen enough. turn it off.
You what? a wire transfer of this size?
If it means getting silent night back, absolutely.
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
He gets to be the hero.
You do everything yorgi says?
Go to hell.
We hung out last night, remember?
What are you talking about?
Of course it matters. hey, hold on!
We'll have to go after them.
Are n't you afraid?
Go to the water, it's that way!
Let me.
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
You ca n't talk to it?
Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
Nice place to start, do n't you think?
That one i'm real familiar with.
I can see that. why?
The corner. anarchy 99.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
What's the deal?
Been to any good diners lately?
He's a pretty good actor, though.
Of course.
This is a gift. from me to you.
What's `` anarchy 99''?
We all do.
I do n't like him being here.
What are you talking about?
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
I'll tell you one thing though.
What's that?
Uh-huh.
I'm sorry. i'm not strong enough.
I wanted to talk to you.
Sure you are, sport.
Some cigars. case of beer.
By reading my thoughts?
If necessary.
What if they're naughty?
He's busy right now.
What do you say?
Not interested.
Suit yourself.
He takes his work seriously.
He takes himself seriously.
I've seen a lot of rings.
Yeah, i'll bet you have.
Senator?
You mutant bastards ...
Let's just say, god works too slowly.
What do you want?
Come with me and i'll let her live.
You're backstage at the encore of creation.
To find rogue.
How?
Actually, magneto helped me put it together.
He helped you?
I'll go.
If she held on any longer she could have.
And you think it helps calling her rogue?
How?
It was xavier's people. they knew.
A piece. only a piece.
Is it enough?
Enough for a test.
Alive.
Oh, shit.
You have the wrong house.
And who might you be?
Dr. frederick fronkonsteen.
The grandson of victor'fronkonsteen'?
No!
What was your grandfather's name?

Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, darling!
Darling!
Surprised!
Love me?
No, of course not. i just meant ...
All right then!
Is it worth taking a chance?
I suppose you're right.
That's my good boy.

No! dr. frankenstein always kept that separate.
May i have it, please?
Will there be anything else?
Fron kon steen!
A week. ten days at most.
What?
Break that old man's violin.
I did n't do that.
One week at the most!?

My name is pronounced fron kon steen.
Oh! i thought it was dr. frankenstein.
No, it's dr. fronkonsteen!
Yes?
Vermicelli.
Nineteen, sir.
I am a scientist ...! not a philosopher.
Fron kon steen!
Are you putting me on?
No, it's pronounced fron kon steen.
I see.
You must be igor.
But they told me it was ee gor.
Yes, just the two.
I beg your pardon?
There wolf! there castle!
Why are you talking like that?
I thought you wanted to.
No.
The wockers with the knockers.
Wockers with the knockers???
Home.
I wonder what's got into them?
What are you doing here?
Just putting up some tea.
Did you hear that strange music?
What?
Did you hear that strange music??
What?
Did you hear that strange music?
Must be the music room.
Could be worse!
How?
Could be raining!
Yes. dr. h. delbruck.
I want that brain.
Was he any good?
That's not bad.
Can you imagine that brain in this body?
Why?
It's always been one of my favorite names.
If you like -- just hurry!
Thank you, master.
This guy means business.
More, do you hear me?
What?
Throw the third switch!
Wait till he sees the bill.
It was n't me.
Give -- me -- your -- hand!
You can say that again.
Yes.
You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
Why?
... i'm glad that's ...
No, no! that whole thing!
Act casual!
What did you find out?
Someone was playing this in the music room.
How do you know it was a'he'?
All right -- where is she?
How do you know it was a'she'?
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
Can you play it?
Maybe ... if you get here on time.
That's what we're paid for.
He's carrying her off now through the woods.
I'll bet it's a doozy.
Is everything ready?
It's alive!
Mmmmmmmmmmmm.
How's everything?
Mmmmm! mmmmm!
How sweet! such a quaint little tune.
Ja, ja.
How nice.
Yes, thank you. it was n't bad.
I'm not sure i ... get your drift.
What is it? is something wrong, doctor?
Listen! do n't you hear that strange music?
Yes! what could it be at this hour?
What a filthy mess.
Well, this explains the music.
But who was playing it?
Perhaps we'd better leave.
Yes!
I know.
Raise the platform, hurry!
Oh! yes, doctor.
I thought it was wonderful.
I think you've done it, master.
What do you think we should do?
I think i'll ... carry him.
Me? sing?
Yes -- quickly, dear!
This is not the finals -- just sing!
Stop -- singing!!!
Are you serious??
Give him the sedative!
Oh! yes, doctor.
I think so.
Good night!
Of course not.
No. nor to elizabeth.
Yes, elizabeth has hers.
But, after all, you have yours.
And i have mine.
Why do n't we talk inside?
Well ... ... perhaps for a few minutes.
It would n't be fair to her.
Yes, i know.
You've got to help me to remain faithful.
Yes, i will.
Mmmmmmmmm!
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
There must have been someone else down here then.
