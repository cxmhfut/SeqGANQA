Well, yes, i admit it is.
Would you tell me why?

No, really!
Papa, is this your idea?
No one calls you that.
Yes, thank you, sir.
Madame <unk> is here for her lesson, sir.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Do any pupils come to the house?

Where does he work?
What medicine?

Well, we can.
Mio caro <unk>.
Dear mozart, my sincere congratulations.
Did you like it, then?
Whom did they choose?
Of course not.
Do you have a daughter?
What exactly are you working on?
Oh, excellency, would you?
With all my heart, mozart.
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
Grazie, mio caro, wolfgang!
Mozart. it was good of you to come.
How could i not?
Did my work please you?
How could it not, excellency?
Yes?
I never knew that music like that was possible.
I have come to commission work from you.
What work?
A mass for the dead.
Do you mean that?
Are you ill?
The doctor thinks i am. but-
What?
Shall i answer it?
No! no, it's him!
Who?
The man. he's here.

Consigned to flames of woe.

A fire which never dies. burning one forever?
Oh, yes.
Strange!

You go fast!
Do you have it?
Do you want to rest a bit?
I'm not leaving you.
I am so ashamed.
You mean in turkey?
That will do, herr mozart!
What are you doing, herr director?
What is this, herr chamberlain?
Because his majesty wishes it.
Is the emperor angry with me?
No, but i'm the best.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Well done, mozart. really quite fine.
So?
In the sight of god that is a sin.
What do you want?
Do you understand that you have sinned? gravely.
Leave me alone.
Where?
Here in vienna.
Well?
Ah- you've heard that?
All vienna has heard that.
And do they believe it?
Is it true?
Do you believe it?
Did you try?
You can not say that!
I did.
No, you did n't!
I poisoned his life.
But not his body.
You mean that play?
Exactly.
He's setting that play to music?
Yes.
Are you absolutely sure?
I've seen the manuscript.
Where?
Well, mozart is already rehearsing.
Incredible.
What anger?
About the ballet.
Bravo, your majesty!

No, why?
Is david acting strangely?
Could you get here without any trouble?
He's fine. we'll come right over.
Shall i send a car?
No, a cab will be faster.
What shall we do?
It was n't a lunatic.
I beg your pardon?
It was a wolf.
What?
Mr. kessler?
Yes?
You have n't eaten your lunch.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.

It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
Okay.
The next corner we can get a cab.
I should be committed.
But ...
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
What?
We had an argument. he's being silly.
Hopeless. it's hopeless.

Get out of the way.
No fighting. it was n't bob's fault.
Shit, dignan.
Eleven fifteen.

I come from a big family.
Lenny? come on!

Why there is no other man in my life?
No. no, rick. not tonight.
Can i tell you a story, rick?
Has it got a wow finish?
How did you get in?
Put them on the table.
Everything is quite all right.

This time they really mean to stop me.
I must find out what berger knows.
Be careful.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
Manages what?
His escape.
This is the end of the chase.
Why two?
He is traveling with a lady.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
I have my orders.
Yeah, you were saying?
Oh, no, rick never --
As i suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist.
Yeah? why?
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
Oh, thanks.

How d'you know we're `` friends''?
Please! please! what are those?

It was different ...
But you loved her all the same ...
I've never loved anybody!
`` the fifth one this week''!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Five this week; how many the week before?
You're as bad as my father.
We must n't let him land!
Who?
Halfdan the black.
Just give me a hand.
Where's the cloak invisible?

But you do n't realize ....
You still want to go to asgaard?
Of course.
Do you believe i love you?
Yes -- i believe you do.
The second note.
Then i shall come too.
No ... no ...
But --
How do we know this is the way?
We blew the horn resounding.
What do you see, erik?
I see the world.
Is it night or day, erik?
It is day, of course, freya.
Is there nothing men can do?
The gods are asleep, erik.
And will the dead ever return, freya?
Well, obviously there's no killing.
A lot of people like our singing.
I'm sure it's lovely.
Really?
I'll tell you what ...
Careful! they're not supposed to hurt you.
He's trying to stop us waking the gods.
Do n't talk nonsense.
He wants to kill us!
Not when we explain about the great blessing.
But it is! look!
Looting and pillaging, eh?
Yes.
What about the raping?
Of course i like women ... i love'em.
Oh, get it over with.
I do n't suppose ... no ...
About raping me?
About not raping you ...
Oh! stop talking as if we were married!
Scream.
Ah.
Louder.
Aaagh! rape!
You told them i raped you -- why?
I dunno ... you looked so ... so vulnerable ...
Why should you care?
Why ... should you care?
What a stupid idea.
Have you tried to ask the god for anything?
Why should you care?
Find the rainbow bridge?
`` but'' what?
But ...
What are you talking about?
It's halfdan the black!
Erik! row! what are you doing?
How deep is the ocean?
Let's hack her to pieces.
That's terrible!
Halfdan the black's here!
I know!
We're missing all the fun ...
What's it all about?
You talking <unk>, son?
Where does it all get us, grandpa?
Who have you been talking to?
I met this girl ...
It's always the women that start the trouble.
She got me thinking ...
I ... i ... killed her ...
Slower! nobody can row at that speed!
Slower! in ... out ...
Faster!
What are you doing here?
Shut up!
Look, the sky is blue ...
It's magic.
What `` magic'' have you brought, erik?
What did he say?
You must help us.
But you're the gods!
Thank you very much indeed.
Now stop it!
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
A magic <unk>.
Were n't we supposed to?
No! let go, snorri!
I've got you!
There is another way.
Who gets killed?
You need to say a bit more than that!
What's the matter with them?
Just say something cheerful.
Wait, erik!
What do you think?
And you, keitel blacksmith.
Well, what else do we do?
What are you talking about, erik?
Nobody's ever crossed the rainbow bridge to asgaard.
Hey, you two! what's going on?
Look, i bagged it last week.
I am one, dad!
Row!
She has n't got any.
Hy-brasil?
Sven!
I came to find my grandfather.
Bye, leif.
Bye ... sorry ...
Yeah ... well ...
You will wait?
What's all the panic about?
It ca n't do you any harm ...
How did he do that?
Do what?
Vanish into thin air?
He has n't.
Same thing, is n't it?
You know, my son, our lord said ...
Are you all right?
He used to puke in his sleep.
Oh! who cares? we're home!
Aaagh!
Let me go, sven.
What are you talking about?
Well! come on!
What?
What are you doing, keitel blacksmith?
Get away, snorri.
They chase fenrir the wolf from the sky ...
The age of ragnarok ends ...
My brother blacksmiths!
That's right.
The blacksmith's code says i must ...
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
Together we stand!
Was n't it, keitel?
Are you going to let erik wake the gods?
Sh! hurry!
I ca n't swim! i ca n't swim!
Relax!
<unk>! argh! let go, you idiot!
Help!
Help!
Shut up!
She knows it was our fault!
I should have got rid of you long ago!
It's a tradition.
I was a berserk for king harald <unk> ...
So did your father ...
So did my father and his father before him.
But it's a responsibility ...
But it's a responsibility being a berserk.
Not now, sven ...
I must kill! kill!
Kill! kill!
Hold it! hold it in!
Well, of course he is!
There! that's a true berserk.
Well, go on! go berserk!
There is nothing we can do ...
He drove me mad!
Dad!
Well i'm certainly not, either.
Well ... i'm game.
Thorfinn! you ca n't die!
I'm not frightened ... of anything ...
You'll see my grandfather in valhalla!
No ... he's not ... not ... there ...
And you've got both axes?
Yes, mother.
And something to sharpen them with?
No, mother.
And keep your sword greased.

Does <unk> really like this show?
Hey- why do you have this?
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.

I remember every minute of that party.
Hey! we forgot to call the loser!
Which loser?

You call.
Why do i always have to do it?
Look, maybe that's him!
I want to `` make love'' to him.

It's obviously him!
Do you think he knows?
Are you sure?
He's insane!

Was n't it like eighth grade?
Now are you going to get a regular job?
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
I think one of us should fuck josh ...
Go ahead ...
No, really ...
Look, we have to get these ...

Do n't you want nice stuff?
Hello?

He came into work.
Why? what did he say?
Nothing.

Really?
Wow! what was that all about?
Uh ... hello?
Hi, it's me ...
Oh, hi ...

Does that mean you do n't like me?
No, of course not.
So, do you like me, seymour?
In what way do you mean?
What are you doing here?
I had to see you.
What's up?
Can you at least let me in?
What's the matter?
Uh ... i think there's some root beer ...
What do you want?
What do you want?
What? ... maybe ... no ... i dunno ...
I will if you want to.
No ... forget it ...
I-i never expected anything like this to happen ...
But, i ...
They're seymour's.
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
Yeah, well ... thanks for cheering me up.
I agree.
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
Yeah.
I am.
What do we have here, margaret?
This shocking image of repressed <unk>!
She's not at home?
Maybe she's with josh?
Josh!? why would she be with josh?
I do n't know.
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
What do you mean?
On that pathetic fake blind date.
Seymour?
Yes?
<unk> epidemic; very sudden.
Let me see the sick.
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
Morning, friend, glorious day.
I am a man of peace.
Am i to take it you want to live?
Starting now, we attack them.
But i have in <unk> every country presents problems.
Pleasant journey?
Lovely sound- they seem happy.
Do n't they, though?
I do need to see starling.
Yes he is.
You do n't enjoy killing, do you?
You never had it.
<unk> you need n't be so <unk>
Very good indeed.
I do n't suppose i could watch.
... one shot ...
But you said they were always old.
What a good week.
I did n't have a chance to thank you.
What did i do?
<unk> samuel would have done something.
I can try.
... misfire ... it jammed ...
Has it ever done that before?
Think about something else.
Have you ever failed?
What happened to them?
You think they'll come then? why?
Good luck.
Why?
I am also liaison between these two.
What are they looking at?
You- they can not believe you're still here.
Oh yes, i think so.
For you.
Thank you, samuel.
Good news?
I expect so- it's from my wife.
Do you love her?
I do, actually; very much.
You like him, do n't you?
Oh yes. but it takes time.
You've known him long?
He has children?
Where is it?
Afraid of lions.
How many cattle?
Four should do it.
Did you ever see a lion that size?
Some mysteries should not have solutions.
I'm sorry. perhaps some other time.
Okay, whatever you think -- but not venkman.
Oh no.
Do you ever see him?
Occasionally
Does he ever mention me?
I wo n't.
No, you did n't, frank.
Okay, that's no problem.
His name is oscar.
I'll do it.
That's where the buggy stopped.
Good luck.
So this is what you do, huh?
Oh, hello, peter.
That's not true. it was <unk>.
Sorry!
Who are you going to call?
Should we go?
I do n't think we should leave her alone.
Too bad for the <unk>.
Dr. venkman? dana is not here.
I know.
I, vigo, the scourge of carpathia --
Yes, the scourge --
-- the sorrow of moldavia --
-- the sorrow --
I command you.
You've got to do something!
These boys are n't playing around.
Your honor, may i approach the bench?
Can i have some of your water?
Like what?
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
Yes, i did. we were city champs.
Egon!
That's a thousand million electron volts.
You were supposed to help me with this.
From where -- neptune?
Nothing. not a trace.
Seems like a pretty <unk> guy, huh?
I'm egon --
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
That's it. it's on the bottom.
Do n't shoot! you'll hit ray!
Is the line sinking?
Rivers of the stuff!
Late renaissance, i think. caravaggio or <unk>.
Oh, hiya, pete.
Great. so what are you guys working on?
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Who?
Who? just -- someone we know.
Who? who? who?
Aaah! nobody! i ca n't tell you!
Who, ray?
Geez, i forgot how heavy these things are.
I'm ray --
It looks like a giant jello mold.
My fault!
Ready?
I'm ready.
Now that's one ugly dude.
Huh? what?
You finished here?
Are you telling me how to drive?
No, i just thought --
And pure --
Kind of makes you wonder, does n't it?
Roy? your clock broke.
Nice going, honey. it was brand new.
Now where are you going?
To the bathroom, where do you think?
<unk>!!
Ready? what is it?
Oh, dana, it's you ...
Hi, louis.
... i thought it was the drug store.
Oh, dana, it's you.
Are you the gatekeeper?
We're all professionals here, miss ...
Is that your professional opinion?
I'd have to say <unk>'s third concerto.
You really do n't act like a scientist.
No? what do i act like?
Like a used car salesman.
That's too bad.
What?
Uh-huh.
Well, let's check it out.
You're quite a housekeeper.
I told you, i ...
Damn!
Are you all right?
All right. what do you want to do?
I think i should spend the night here.
That's it. get out.
On a purely scientific basis.
Out!
I want to help you.
I'll scream.
Do n't scream.
All right.
Okay. then i'll go.
Goodbye.
Great rehearsal.
You heard it?
There is no dana. i am zuul.
What's that got to do with it?
Did you see it? what was it?
I collect spores, <unk> and fungus.
Oh, that's very- unusual.
I think it's the food of the future.
Die in what sense?
I want you to have this.
Great! how's it going?
Are you peter venkman?
I have ph.d's in psychology and parapsychology.
I see. and now you catch ghosts?
Yes, it would.
And may i see this storage facility?
No, you may not.
And why not, mr. venkman?
Because you did n't say the magic word.
And what is the magic word, mr. venkman?
May i please see the storage facility?
All right. what is it?
A square?
Circle?
Nervous?
Two wavy lines?
Hey, mister! can i see those guns?
Yes?
Were you recently in the bathroom?
Oh! you're here.
I'm always serious.
Something was definitely here.
What?
Do n't cross the beams.
Why not?
Trust me. it will be bad.
Where's the keymaster?
She said he was `` the destructor.''
Who?
Gozer.
Life is just a state of mind.
Sorry, buddy!
What do you mean by `` seen?''
I told you it's real.
What do we do now?
I do n't know. talk to it.
What do i say?
For what purpose?
So do i.
Ray -- something's here.
Where are you, pete?
Third floor. get down here,
Do n't move. it wo n't hurt you.
How do you know?
Who was the architect?
Agile bastard, is n't he?
What? what popped in there?

Boy! solid cores of shielded selenium <unk>.
Do you believe in god?
And the seas would boil ...
Right. and the sky would fall ...
Judgement day ...
Stantz? you okay in there?
We're nearly there, <unk>.
If i may be so bold ...
For the gods, spit it out!
Tribuus ... tomorrow.
What are you talking about?
I am their hero!
Not yet, dear brother ...
That's difficult to say, general.
Then you'd be out of a job.
Caesar?
They wo n't break this one.
Maybe it'll crush gaius.
I'm serious.
Marcus aurelius has died.
Where is my father?
Yes, caesar?
I've read of it.
The trouble is defining exactly what'right' is.
Why you?
You can not die.
The senators admire you.
Tomorrow?
As soon as i can.
On your honor as a roman officer, daddy?
My troops do n't make policy.
You brought the army into rome.
He's very realistic.
What about their philosophy lessons?
They're studying with cynics.
You need to come home!
Let him trust quintus.
Quintus is overly idealistic.
Take your hands off me animal!
I refuse to be your slave. i refuse --
I did n't get killed and everyone else did.
You get to come alive again in the country!
Fantastic! wonderful! but posters are very expensive.
Before they leave, get gold.

Well, i want you to leave.
Elaine -- i love you.

Yes.
When?
I do n't see how we can.
We just can.
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
I'll think about it.
You really will?

Either one will be fine.
Thank you.
Would this be easier for you in the dark?
Mrs. robinson -- i ca n't do this.
You what?
This is all terribly wrong.
Benjamin, is this your first time?
You can admit that, ca n't you?
Are you kidding?
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
Wait a minute!
On your first time --
Who said it was my first time?
That you're afraid --
If you want.
Well what do you want to talk about?
Oh my god.
Oh.
Neither.
You're not interested in art?
No.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
Do you really want me to?
Yes i do.
What one.
What?
What novel did you read.
There!
There is n't any.
How do you get out of the house?
I walk out.
What do you say to him?
He's asleep.
Always?
The driveway's on my side of the house.
We're talking.
Calm down, benjamin.
Now let's keep going here.
Can i undress and talk at the same time?
Right.
No we do n't.
Well how long has this been going on.
About five years.
Oh no. are you kidding me?
Man, is this interesting.
Not exactly.
Well how do you feel about him, then?
No.
What?
I never did, benjamin. now let's --
Why did you do that?
See if you can guess.
Well i ca n't.
Not particularly.
And you were a student also.
Yes.
At college.
Yes.
What was your major?
Art.
Kind of.
Well how did it happen?
Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
I'm curious.
We'd go to his car.
Oh no. in the car you did it?
What kind of car was it?
What?
Do you remember the make of the car?
Oh my god.
Really. i want to know.
That's enough.
Do n't talk about elaine.
Do n't talk about elaine?
No.
Why not?
I wish you'd tell me.
Good.
I was just kidding around.
Good.
But why should n't i?
I have my reasons.
Then let's hear them.
I would n't know.
Well, i'm not.
Are you?
That i'm a sick and disgusting person.
Now do n't start this.
What?
Did i say that?
You would n't.
If that's how you feel --
May i stay then?
Yes. please. i want you to.
Then give me your word you wo n't.
This is absurd.
Mrs. robinson --
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
I do n't believe you.

Goodnight, benjamin.
You believe me, do n't you?
No.
I'm going up to berkeley today.
They do n't know?
No -- they do n't.
Well -- when did you decide all this?
When did you two talk this over?
I'm just --

Well --
About what?
I guess -- about my future.
To be what?
Have you thought about graduate school?
Say that again.
Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
Here. it looks like you need a refill.
Oh no.
What?
Thank you very much, sir.
Ben -- how old are you now?
Sir?
You'll never be young again.
I know.
Ben, can i say something to you?
What?
Quite a while.
I've watched you grow up, ben.
I will.
But why?
Why?
It should n't make any difference what happened.
You miss the point.
Hello.
Mrs. robinson?
Yes?
It's benjamin.
Yes?
Benjamin braddock.
Benjamin -- where are you?
Can you see me now?

I could take care of her.
How?
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you ...

Chasing what?
You were very different yesterday.
That was lovely.
Will you do me a big favor?
I'll do anything for you.
Would you like to make a man happy?
Yes -- i'd love to.
Then dance the next number with kringelein.
Why?
I feel sorry for him.
Going?
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
You live here?
For tonight.
Oh!
Yes -- oh!
Well -- such is life, flaemmchen.
Please do not be frightened, madam.

And -- and --
How tired you are!
Yes -- tired ...
You must n't talk russian to me.
Strange man ...
And ...?
What can you see?
You are beautiful!
Oh! what a picture -- and what else?

Do n't.
On the train?
Yes -- i will be on the train.
Till then.
Thank you, sir.

A drink, baron -- a louisiana flip?
If we could scare up some men to play.
We could come to my room.
Ready, kringelein?
Is that too much, baron?
No -- not at all.
All right then.
That was my last.
You've lost everything?
I've no luck.
I take five hundred.
Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.
Good evening, mr. pimenov.
Oh -- good evening, baron.
Certainly -- always when grusinskaya dances.
Well -- last night was not so good.
I thought she was splendid!

Oh, let the poor devil alone.
We shall see who remains here the longer.
Hello! hello! --

What's the problem?
It's my lucky day.
Hi.
Want to buy a bed?
What's happening?
We're leaving.
Will you sign for the bed?
Alright, let's give it another try.
That your daughter?
Uh-huh.
Got her mother's looks.
Oh.
Julia's my second wife.
The box ... you opened it. we came.
No time for argument.
You did this before, right?
Many times.
Nobody escapes us.
We want the man who did this --
Just in time.
We've got such sights to show you --
Please. get back into bed.
You were holding onto it like grim death.
Julia!
No.
You remember.
No.
No.
One last time. give me the box.
Come to daddy.
This is n't happening.
You bastard --
Poor baby.
You're julia, right?
That's right. who are you?
I'm brother frank.
Oh.
There is going to be a wedding?
Oh. oh yes.
Well?
I do n't want to see the dress.
But you said --
What about larry --
Wedded bliss?
I'm very happy.
Julia.
Oh my god.
Do n't look at me.
Who are you?
Help me.
Tell me who you are.
... somebody ...
I'm hurting
Hurting.
My nerves ... are beginning to work again.
Good.
Poor larry. obedient as ever.
Ssh. do n't want babe to hear.
Later.
Not know.
A long time.
This is what began it.
You're still afraid.
You would be. they tore me apart.
You ca n't love him.
I do n't.
So where's the harm?
That's probably her now. or the police.
Maybe.
Do n't you care?
There's very little i can do about it.
Maybe we should just leave --
Like this? look at me! like this?
Well we ca n't just stay here --
Kirsty.
Hi. i got soaked.
There's a towel in the bathroom.
Which is where?
Sure.
Kirsty? it's very late.
Where's daddy?
What's the problem?
I have to see my father.
You look terrible. have you had an accident?
I was here this afternoon.
This afternoon.
No, damn you --
It's one of these.
We're going to freeze to death.
Maybe somebody changed the lock.
Like who?
Just a thought --
It smells damp.
How long since you were here?
Why did n't he want to sell it?
Not exactly modern.
We'll sell it. sell everything.
You're still blaming me.
All right.
So what's the argument?
No argument.
Larry!
Where are you?
Well?
Why not?
How are you doing through there?
What have you done?
You're not going to faint.
Shit.
It's probably going to need stitches.
I'm going to throw up.
Take it slowly.
So damn stupid.
You're done worse.
I'll be scarred for life.
Julia?
I'm here.
Are you all right?
Just feeling a bit sick.
Can i get you anything?
Maybe a brandy.
Sure.
I'll be down in a minute
Who was it?
Is this upsetting you?
Are you all right?
Fine.

Larry ...
Oh baby.
Do n't go upstairs.
Huh?
Please ...
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong?
I do n't know where to begin ...
What are you talking about?
Not much fun, is it?
What?
Drinking alone.
Not much.
What are you drinking?
Just soda.
Plain soda?
That depends.
There's a first time for everything.
I suppose that's right.
Well, is n't it?
No. no. let's go upstairs.
Is this your place?
Do you care?
No, not much.
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
No personal details?
This is n't the bedroom.
What's going on?
I suppose not.
First time for everything.
Why do n't you do the same?
You know, you're very beautiful.
Oh christ.
What's wrong?
You're awake. good girl.
What happened to me?
I'll get the doctor.
Who brought me in here?
You would n't believe me.
Who's there?
Kirsty?
I got through.
Where are you?
I found a room.
What did you say?
No dad.
You'd like the house.
You'd like my room.
You will keep in touch.
Of course. every day.
O.k.
Take care, dad.
Call me tomorrow.
Big house.

Surprise.
Are you o.k.?
What are you drinking, love?
I've forgotten.
I just wanted to be sure you were o.k.
Never better. you sleep well.
Yeah.
I love you, honey.
... maybe we should never have come back.
Maybe you should give it some time.
She does n't even want to leave the house.
Really?
It's like she's waiting for something.
Sure.
I have to talk to you.
Finished?
He's gone.
Poor frank. he's better off dead.
I do n't believe it.
I'm afraid it's true.
I want to see.
No you do n't.
Yes!
Get the fuck out of here.
What's the problem?
Please. you're in danger.
Where are you going?
We're on the cointreau.
I wo n't be able to stand.
You're not going?
Need any help?
I'm here.
I thought we'd lost you.
You know i do know the way home.
It's late.

It's the best collection i've ever seen.
But you must have --
Sixty.
Thirteen hundred.

Can i buy this otis redding single off you?

Claymore.
You're the expert.
You're very macabre.

Do you play?
Yes.
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
Byzantine?
Good reflexes.
Grave robbers?
Probably.
Who?
People like that rarely leave business cards.
You have an active imagination.
I have friends.
Why not?
Tradition.
He tried to kill me last night.
Where?
Who is he?
At the moment? carl smith.
He called you `` macleod''.
That bothers you?
What about me?
Have you gone to the police?
I'd rather hear yours.
He sees me as a threat.
No.
No one knows you're here?
You had to do <unk>!
You're wrong.
You're a fool.
Is this what you killed them with?
You did kill those men.
Not all of them.
Yes.
No. so what now? we just wait?
Yes.
It's beautiful.
William taupin seems to have left his mark.
Yes.
And you are william taupin, are n't you?
Then you must be at least 70 years old.
At least.
A factor of age.
I hope i never get that old.
I see.
I'm not even sure why.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
Who are you?
That would be difficult to explain.
That's why smith called you macleod.
Yes.
He knows about you.
That's insane.
Perhaps. there is something more. an inheritance.
Of bodies.
I did n't kill the watchman.
You killed those other two.
What about that family in <unk>?
There are differences.
You kill with your left hand?
I have n't killed _you_.
Do n't.
Come here, brenna.
What is it you want?
Get out.
The inheritance.
Forget it.
Thanks.
I'm calling an attorney.
You and i should talk first.
Four?
All fashionably without heads.
You're an asshole, moran.
I want taupin.

It's that important?
I do n't believe him.
Requiem <unk> <unk>

You know me home. me name.

Does it change with me in the room?
It is less.
You feel you know me.
I do n't know why.
I do n't understand.
You are still so very young.
I'm twenty-two.
What?
It is as you are.
Listen to me. hear the words.
This is madness!
It is the truth.
This ca n't be.
Harder. concentrate harder.
Me arm hurts.
Harder! you swing like an impotent cow!
Impotent cow.
It will take less effort as you learn.
I'm your future husband, remember?
Some think not.
Leave me alone, conor. please.
Oh please. another one.
What would you like?
Something pretty.
Far away.
David.
Who am i deceiving?
State of grace and all that.
Tradition.
Romirez understood. not you.
Finish your prayers?
Your name?
What is your position?
I understand you joined up in <unk>.
Equals?
Wait. i think we understand each other.
It can be different. it must be.
We must talk.
Stay out of it.
You see major? you are not so different ...
Ah, conor, how you look a man.
But ian, he's still but a boy.
Where did you learn that?
My father taught me.
Your father must be smart.
Figure she's with him?
Where!
I do n't know.
Smith. carl smith.
How many came?
The last four.
And the bulgarian?
He got him. he always does. eventually.
Spare a chair?
How are you?
Head still secure to the neck.
He found us even there.
I knew his great-grandfather.
Long time.
Friend of yours?
Of sorts.
Run!
Leave her out of this.
What's the point?
Tradition.
It's all we have.
Perhaps miss cartwright would like to play.
Leave her alone.
We have some unfinished business.
Are you here?
I want you to come to me.
Yes laddie, i have her.
This your present address?
Did you know the victim?
What were _you_ looking for?
That's none of your business.
Do you know what this is?
A mystery.
My condolences.
Where were you tuesday night?
Home.
A neighbor saw your car leave.
Do you?
Steven, conor did n't die.
You're one of william's kids, huh?
We were very close.
The resemblance is amazing.
When may i expect the cleaners?

Damn them!
Save your mischief for the black baron.
Aye! that too.
You'll need more than bird droppings for blackheart.
We must follow that bird.
This is ogre's magic.
Foul fellow, this couer de noir.
The foulest. mayhap i can cut them free.
Worse than the battlefield.
Good.
My god! look!
Something the matter?
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
I should hope not!
God's blessing.
What make ye of that, jack?
Wait!
Long as we do n't lose heart, jack ...
Wait, jack.
Can we trust him?
Never felt so cold in all me born days ...
Give in to despair and all is lost.
Defend ourselves. we've bested far worse already.
There is n't much time!
Been telling you that all along, lad.
One more turn ...
Aye. before the wee <unk> attacked.
Then it's godspeed, screwball.
He'll be atop the portculis ere long.
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
Aye. we're good as inside.
It does n't matter.
Nonsense! course it matters.
Sunlight, you say?
Aye. hurry now, gump, the key!
Mean you to seek him out below?
What weapon?
Sunlight.
Will you explain what's going on?
Do n't get too far!
Never show mercy!
Ride like wild fire, jack.
A good day for singing ...
I've not heard a note out of you.
Not in the mood, i'm afraid.
I'm not denying it's a joyous day --
I was with the princess.
Where?
By the pond. she was teasing me.
Barely living, from the looks of it.
Well done, lad.
Sweet slippers of <unk>!
How're these?
Dolt!
These for me?
You promised!
Never.
But you did ... you did!
I may have said perhaps ...
Liar!
Blackheart. aptly named.
Oh, fie. what about the unicorn?
Unicorn?
A promise is a sacred oath.
Stop complaining.
What shall we do?
Oh, dear.
How much longer?
Are you honest?
Where are you going?
Who?
They tricked you.
My own father ...
He did run?
I do n't want it on me.
Tis not fit for a princess.
Be it fit for your wife, green jack?
I have no wife.
Then, perchance you'll me.
Lili! no!
What have i done?
I thought you were dead ... i --
I was bewitched ... it's better this way ...
No! i wo n't let it happen ...
What?
Sunlight ... it destroys him.
Sunlight?
That's why he goes masked during the day ...
So, he's hiding in the dark ...
Lili ... i love you!
What's the matter?
Ouch! something's biting me.
Biting you?
Pinching me!
Pinching? where?
Everywhere! ow!
Oona? do you suppose it's a faerie?
Step lively now!
Ask away, sweet man.
What became of the princess?
Is she fair, this princess?
Exceeding fair.
She's dead!
No!
Dead, dead, dead.
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
You'll visit again?
Courage, jack.
This is not the time for squabbling.
I'd be honored.
Only that?
I had no thought of offending you, oona.
Do i not please you, jack?
In every way.
That was in jest.
Jest with me then.
And sweet?
Nay, oona, tis not possible.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
You ... you ... you mortal you!
What do we do now?
What's she doing?
I'm in your debt, screwball.
Praise be to god.
Where?
What care the bones when the soul is free?
Sorry, jack.
How came you by this blade?
Uhm ... fine work.
You're with us in battle.
Can you show us the way?
Plenty treasure inside ... jimmy seen it once.
You've been inside?
Marco!
What are you doing?
Dad's disappeared!
Are you going to see sam again?
Did you know him before you knew dad?
He's not there.
He's here. check the bathroom.
When does george get to come see his house?
What's that for?
Mom said i should.
Oh.
He has n't called?
Do you guys feel like painting?
What color?
Red.
Mom?
I put him to work.
I could n't get it to go down.
You'd better call and cancel.
What are you doing up so early?
Why? what do you mean?
I'm going to bed.
Atonement.
Sorry i got you into trouble.
He must.
He seems lonely.
Are you his friend?
No.
I'm living here while i build another house.
Do n't you have school?
What's today?
My keys.
You're a good girl.
My mother would die.
It's not what i was expecting.
Hey.
Where to?
I'm supposed to be in tahoe.
Your dad's really gon na build his house?
You should stay.
I do n't know.
Where's your dad?
He jumped into the ocean.
He's a freak.
You look better without make-up.
I might not stay, anyway.
I'll get your back.
Do you remember me from when you lived here?
Yeah.
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
Really?
I wanted him to marry her.
Why?
Huh?
I can use your mom's.
Hand me a towel. i'm getting out.
I'm coming in.
I do n't want you to!
We're not gon na do anything.
Why are you so stupid?
What's the point of this?
Are you sure you're totally into guys?
What are you talking about?
Josh said ...
I thought i was helping you.
On the <unk> or your shoulders?
You'd hate him for the trick.
Where are you?!
Floating to catalina.
He wo n't leave my room.
Will he talk to me?
And of course the beck's, with the ...
It could have been a squirt gun.
Are you guys' friends?
Mr. stevens?
A violation?
Oh, yes.
And if i enclosed it?
An exhaust system or a window is code.
A sink?
I hate to ask about a window.
That would take weeks.
I'm good, thanks.
What are you on?
Pardon me?
Right ... she married ... what was he?
I've been here twenty years.
Maybe that's too long.
Maybe ...?
Oh.
How old are you?
Listen ... maybe i can get you a year.
For everything.
Well, i feel better about this now.
I've got one favor to ask.
Thank you.
Well, it's the least i can do.
Is alyssa home?
She did n't really say.
Sam?
Uh huh.
I did n't recognize you!
Thanks for the shower.
Come over anytime you need to, sam.
Thank you.
You're here early today.
This has got to stop!
There are no windows facing my ... exposure.
George, this is the third time.
The plumber's due out on friday.
You'll have to explain that to the police.
You were the only neighbor i could tolerate.
I forgot where i put my keys.
The whole summer, man. party in tahoe.
Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
To check up on me?
I'll be around to check up on you.
Why would you be there?
Because i live there.
I'm not going!
I'm not going!
You do n't have a choice.
Are you totally insane?!
Probably in the bible.
What are you doing?!
I hate turkey.
Why?
You'll have money when you work.
No one would blame me if i left!
I'd blame you. i want you here.
I'm not doing it!
I'm leaving.
Where are you going?
I do n't know.
When are you going to be back?
Where is it?
A friend of yours is here.
Did you got through my pants?
You're too fucking late.
The gloves on the table are for you.
You ca n't make me do a thing.
Sit down for a second.
Hi, alyssa.
I took some of your <unk>.
I know. why?
I know the feeling.
How do you become something you're not?
What would you like to be?
What i'm not.
What are you now?
Nothing.
I know parts of who you are.
I wish you had told me then.
I'm telling you now.
What would you be doing now?
Getting high, i guess.
Sun glasses?
To hide a black eye.
I loved him too much.
After everything he did to you and your mom?
After everything.
She seemed upset.
The kind where there is n't really an answer.
The kind where there is n't really an answer.
And you told mom today?
I do n't wan na go, sam.
I'd eat a lot of red meat.
What would you do?
Can you build a house in four months?
Good for you.
Was bankrupt and dead before i was twenty.
Thanks for telling me.
Ah! oh ....
I need you to do me a favor.
God, you look like crap, george.
How many bedrooms will your house have?
I just wanted to know where mom was?
Oh. sorry.
It's okay.
She needs to be alone, i think.
Because dad left?
You should lock your doors.
Lock the door behind you.
Where is he?
What are you doing?
He never answers.
A blueprint <unk>.
Where have you been for a week?!
Four days. i left to think.
What did you do with your dog?
Kurt's been feeding him.
I need to talk to you.
Why would they tow your truck?
I was parked in day parking.
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
I love those doors.
Where will you live?
Forget it, really. i'll survive.
I want him with me.
Hey, hey!
I do n't have a phone.
I drove over and you were gone.
I ca n't leave the house?
I did say he could go.
We're fine. turkey sandwiches.
It makes me sad.
What?
Which?
It's not breakfast yet.
I dreamed about your house last night.
That was n't a dream. that was sam.
With your hands or your tongue?
I thought you'd be up with the sun.
Do you need help?
It's been a while.
I smiled at him.
I thought we were helping.
Nothing is going on with us, is it?
That was the truth.
It sounded like a pick-up line.
I'm married.
You bit my finger.
Let's not do this, okay?
Is your back still killing you?
No. mostly me.
Peter left me yesterday.
What did he say?
Back. neck. back.
I could die.
Are you going to kiss me?
Do n't move!
I better get the kids home.
Been thinking?
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
Does alyssa know?
Nothing.
You got any weed?
What's your deal with alyssa?
Do n't even ... i'm there.
It's just a joke. a stupid joke.
He said he heard hammering.
Then you tell me, what just happened?
His father is a man.
We've eaten.
Is lois still here? i'm starved.
Should i?
To shave your chest?
I'm helping george build his house.
I ca n't go right now.
I was talking about our marriage.
That sounds pathetic, does n't it?
You never really trusted me.
You live a fabulous life, robin.
Despite you.
I never asked for more.
That's the problem.
Where are the kids?
Sam took them to a movie.
No.
You do n't look like you.
Hey.
Hey.
You got a dog?
I've missed you guys.
Do you know anything about building a house?
No.
I guess i could teach you some things.
What are you doing in my room?
Can you stay for dinner?
The door was open.
You're sure about this?
Yeah.
You could keep it and rent it out?
Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
Why?
Queer.
What did you say?
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
I brought a few of my own.
Adam, that's not true!
Nothing r, okay?

Goodnight, mr. wilkins. mr. pike.

You went to monroe?

My daddy gave me this watch.
You're soft.
Alright. you want some pie?
Here i am.
Guess we better get going, huh?
You lost all our money in a card game?
I think he's hurt pretty bad.

Cookie drew me a map to greenville.

You still got that map?
What'd you say?
Absolutely. the map is very clear.
Cookie did n't draw it. i did.

You show them crawfords how to play ball.
Well, if that's the way it is ...
That's the way it is.
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
What the hell are you doing?
Go where, ray?
Do n't make me take them away from you.
What'd you say?
Why do n't he just tell'em the truth?
I ca n't eat this.
Just put some mustard on it and eat it.
You did n't get ketchup?
So?
I know you're not talking to me ...

Soft and supple. like a lady's.

I am concentrating. where can we rule?
We could create our own hell there.

Hello, cassius.

All these good people have totally been led astray.
A mountain goat? that's really sweet.

But there may be a few around somewhere.
Where are they?
What's beyond this place -- do you know?
No, no, no
Did your mother or father ever mention another place?

To most people, it's an awful letdown.
That depends on what they see.

What?
Stop now.
Where's your wife, henry?
Go to hell.
I was ... never satisfied.
What's that?
What is it?
It's a thought i had.
What exactly is it supposed to do?

What do you do?
Althea has n't told you?
You're the doctor, what do you think?
I'm sorry, your honor.
What?
So, is this like a japanese restaurant?
I'd better get in there.
Meat loaf, turkey <unk>, or salad nicoise.
Salad nicoise? i love salad nicoise.

Can you help mom?
I'm trying.
What's wrong with her?
Hiya, doc.
Martin.

We're going for a walk.
Ph.d., psychologist.
Oh ... not a real doctor.
Finally, some common sense ...

I think you know what i mean.
No, i really do n't.
I think you do.
Wow. you're something.
Well, look who's here ...
Good evening, mrs. cook.
Just who is here, can you tell me?
Hmm.
I'm not making any promises.
We'll turn back anytime you want.
Is she against you getting help?
We do n't discuss it.
Please ... forgive me.
You've got a funny idea of funny.
I've offended you!
No.
Is this the treatment?
I'm embarrassed. the list is so long.
Sore throat?
Where?
I can give myself a headache instantly.
That was really bad, was n't it?
Disgusting.
And i'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
You like it?
It's all right.
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
That's what i like.
Which thing?
My brother said you were about to fire me.
-- you've been a tremendous help to me.
Is something wrong, sofie?
Yes, something's very wrong, dr. mumford.

Hello?

Which show was that?

Anything ... just ask.
You got off easy.
Will you wait for me?
We're only talking about six weeks.
In maybe three or four issues.

What are you talking about?
Was it something that happened at school?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
What'd he say?
You're doc mumford. skip skipperton.
Would you like another beer?

Skip, that's not much of a secret.
Who else knows?
Damn! what is your name?

I've told you a lot of private stuff.
I can tell you anything else.

Everybody has a story, skip.
An irs investigator with a drug problem?
It was n't the best situation.
`` get to know your therapist.''
You were messed up, man.
At least you pulled yourself out ...
Things got a lot worse.
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
I know it starts with a birth certificate ...
No ... no training.
Psych major?
I've never brought anyone down here before.
Sorry ...
I guess that makes sense.
You know where he's taking her?
Who the hell are these guys?
I never killed a priest before.
They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
And how does one do that?
By reading the book of the dead.
Oh yes, of course.
And then killing your sister.
Now go find me a big stick.
What then? robbery? extortion? kidnapping!
None of the above, thank you.
Let's make us even, shall we?
C'mon, friend.
Why do you like to fight so much?
This is prince imhotep, high priest of <unk>.
Where's your new friend?
Immune from what?

Intestines.
Miss <unk>. gentlemen.
And you think this justifies killing innocent people!?
You will not believe it.
The sun turning black.

You know your history.
We're almost there.

That `` thing'' gets me excited.
What are those mirrors for?
Oh my god, it's a preparation room.
Preparation for what?
Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.
You two!
I'm going to kiss you, mister o'connell.
No you're not.
I'm not?
Not unless you call me rick.
Why would i do that?
Yeah? so? is that my problem?
I'm staying.
Got it!
Do n't do it, evelyn.
Have you no respect for the dead?

Who's here!?

Do something, jonathan! kill it!
I know you did.
I knew you'd know.
Really?
Um-hmm.
Except for one little thing.
It must have slipped my mind.
Where are you going?
I thought you were done?
Our guests are waiting.
You two timing psychotic bastard.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
So who killed him?
He was the last time i saw him.
When was that?
Much less go outside.
We could really use some coffee --
Come on, baby!
Atta, girl!
Hey, do i look like a man?
Who are you?
And you ca n't count horst <unk> anyway.
It's late. i'm headin' home.
Sounds good to me.
Hey ... can i buy you a beer?
That's two more than the fantastic four.
What did he mean?
Mon captain, it's for you.
Hey ... you okay?
Yes!
Doctor heller?
Yes!
Thanks.
How's your dad?
Snap out of it!
He'll never make it.
Ummm.
I got it.
Superheroes.
Should i kill them?
What did you do with captain amazing?
You're nuts.
They always call the great ones nuts.
And the nuts always call themselves great.
Are you with me ... or against me?
Against.
Thanks for reminding me which team i'm on.
You're dead.
And the light goes out ...
Let me guess ... bullets do n't hurt you.
Are you an actress?
Just a waitress.
Sure -- i guess.
Hi.
I thought you'd chickened out on me.
How'bout giving me `` the tour''?
Who's the artist?
Come here.
I'm not that kind of girl.
Then why are you here?
Curiosity.
I'd better go.
You're a spy.
What?
I saw him walk you home.
Who?
Stay away!
Or talk?
Hi.
Alone tonight?
Date?
Sure.
I admire you.
I would n't mind being famous.
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
What's your real name?
Roy.
It's home.
Me, too.
I just want to be a superhero.
It's me.
At the frankenstein center.
Are you nuts? get out of there!
I'm going inside.
What?
Bye.
You're the sphinx.
The wise snake coils before he strikes.
You drink too much.
When are you going to take off that mask?
My heart died a long time ago.
Oh do n't start that again --
And it would be the right thing to do.
Have you ever seen him?
How could i see him if he's invisible?
You sure that's how you spell it?
But there's still only six of us.
So what else has superman got?
This place is built like a fortress.
Get mad!
But she still might call!
Are you coming or not?
I'll drive.
Cover me!
There's a vague similarity.
So why do n't you just tell her!
I ca n't.
So you're chicken?
Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
Like what? cutting off my own ear?
Or flowers.
Let's go.
I'm soaked. oh great.
Roy --
So where's the art?
What's that?
But ... only when no one is looking.
So you're only invisible ... to yourself?
Firepower costs money.
Yes, <unk>.
You guys going to a costume party?
We're superheroes.
Are you famous?
Not yet.
So what can i get you?
Here you go.
Jeffrey!
Oh hi, mom.
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
Jeffrey, you thief!
Mother ... it's not what you think!
And why are you wearing that silly costume?
But ... the silverware?
I use it ... to fight evil.
Jeffrey ... this is wonderful.
It is?
I always knew that you were special.
Hi.
She likes you.
Definitely.
This is bad.
Who are they?
We may be getting in over our heads here.
This looks like a job for superman --
Or batman --
Do n't crunch the leaves.
Sorry.
Be a mohican.
And there's the sphinx.
And a social life.
To us!
Are you sure he's still lives here?
Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
We're outnumbered twenty to one.
Oh no.
It's time.
We've got lift off!
Where am i going?
Through there!
And, what a delightful idea!
Ah -- you approve?
I think it's absolutely charming.
I'm glad you like it.
Yes -- who spoke up?
Please ...
What forces do you have at your disposal?
About 5,000 troops.
Cavalry?
The 21st dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.
Any cannon?
There are none here.
You could have them here by daybreak.
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
Properly arranged, yes.
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
I'm not insulted.
You realize what is at stake?
They are at the gates of paris, sire.
Who sent my wife and son out of paris?

Everywhere and nowhere, paula the polack.
Not me.
I vote for the motel.
He did n't give you much choice.
There's always a choice.
I forgot to thank you for breakfast.
That was great.
Want me to get a towel?
I'll get it if you want.
What's the matter?
Nothing. go back to the show, paula.
I've seen all that a hundred times.
Hi.
Are those for me?
Because my real father would n't marry her.
Your real father was an officer candidate like me?
Twenty-two years ago.
I'm looking for sid.
So?

I'd like to come with you.

Different tables.

Do me a favor and do n't talk.
Yeah, whatever.
I mean it!
Yeah?
Everything okay?

Somebody called you?
Can we come in?
What do you want?
We'd like to come in.
Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
Could the child please stop that?
That door is a safely hazard.
That's highly inappropriate.
Push that button for me, will you?
Watch your mouth.
Cut it back a little bit.
We're leaving.
Suit yourself.
Nobody leaves.
No cars. feet are faster.
Something's weird.
Makes me nervous.
Why?
No, edgar allen.
Too many stairs.

Fuck him.
Do n't.

He's going down.

Shaky?
Nope.
Chills?
`` what we want is in that room.''
Say fuck.
Fuck.

Small space?

Late summer.
Congratulations.
You call that a compliment?
Next time we'll bring more blankets.
You expect to hold cornwallis with militia?
Personally, i'd prefer stupidity.

You got me beat on both accounts.
You look well, charlotte.
And send us to war alongside massachusetts.
Excuse me?
I said, i'm not my sister.
I know that.
Do you?
Of course, i do.
Goodbye, charlotte.
Two pounds, fourteen ounces.
You're surrendering.
Yes, sir.
What unit?
First virginia regulars under colonel hamilton.
We did.

Colonel will do.
That is a separate issue.
Very well, let us move on to ...
Prisoner exchange.
My harrier. join us, colonel.
Colonel tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels.
Are you going to meet with him?
If i fail, you fail.
Perhaps.
And if i triumph, you triumph.
Probably.
Do you intend to enlist without my permission?
Have you seen any redcoats?
I have to get these dispatches to <unk>.
You're in no condition to ride.
Father ...
We'd cover more ground if we split up.
Is that so?
Did your father teach you humility?
And, corporal ... ... be careful.
How old are you?
You know how old i am.
Flanking riders?
These four wagons must be his.
Father?
No ...
You learned her lessons better than i.
Where?
Do n't go in there.
Is it her? is anne in there?
Father, tell me what happened at fort wilderness?
You know what happened.
Tell me what everyone does n't know.
That's right.
I do n't care. i hate him.
It's mister marion.
A long time ago ...
Thirteen years ...
... time, royal succession, <unk>, bribery ...
One of yours?
I'm sorry.
Who's in command?
I am, i think.
When?
Fall, six months at the earliest.
You expect cornwallis to be held here by militia?
Do n't touch him.
How many men have we seen die?
Goodbye, francis.
Your son, what did you name him?
Lord cornwallis will be with you presently.
How far away?
But what about thomas?
Reverend.
Thank you.
For what?
Gray.
Francis, tell me about general cornwallis.
Remember braddock?
That bad?
Not yet, thomas.
Put those away.
But father, they might come this way.
Father, you ca n't let them take him ...
But where are we going, mr. crandall?
Bite?
They do it to honor the dead, ellen.
It's gorgeous!
Yes, but the rope might be --
Paxcow says it's almost too late!
Please hurry.
Yes.
Have you got a <unk>, ellen?
Is he really all right?
Yes.
Because you promised.
Ellie? what's wrong?
No more chocolate chip cookies.
I'm not tired!
I'm sure you're not.
Do you swear?
You need a glass?
Not at all.
What were you listening to?
Allman brothers.
You folks ready to go on?
Loved that cat pretty well, did n't she?
Bagged cat. what a mess.
Going to tell ellie?
But --
Does she love the cat?
Yes, but --
Yes. where are we going, jud?
Micmacs used to call it little god swamp.
Is there quicksand?
Almost there, louis.
You keep saying that.
This was their burying ground, louis.
I guess so ... but ...
Does n't look like they last long.
Do n't worry about that.
Jud, why am i doing all this?
Can i have another one?
Yes.
Rachel not feeling well?
Out of the mouths of babes, louis.
Ayuh ... how is your cat, louis?
It's ellie's cat.
Shit! look at this mess!
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
Leave me alone!
Let her go. it's cool.
And buckaroo banzai.
Gage's gone!
Thank you. thank you so much.
My god!
I think it's rather extraordinary.
That's enough of that kind of talk!
Getting there.
I got eggs down here!
I'm going to try to do better.
Louis, are you sure?
That boat is my livelihood!
You'll get it back. or one better.
Anamaria, trim the mainsail!
What's in your head, boy?
Enough of that! name your terms.
Elizabeth goes free!
Say the name, or i slit your throat.
That's right.
Blast you! i'll throw you in prison.
You can go to your grave not knowing.
No, i really think i do.
The situation has changed.
There's ... another exit?
Now?
You've got sand, for a maid.
Maid or not, it fits you.
Dare i ask the fate of it previous owner?
Then why are n't you eating?
Do you not know what this is, then?
Man overboard!
Boy overboard!
I ca n't breathe.
Commodore, you ca n't do that!
Elizabeth, i hereby withdraw my proposal.
What?
Then i can wear men's clothing.
Ceremony?
Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --
I'm glad we got here in time.
If i had known --
It does n't!
Miss swann.
You?!
Me!
You're in league with barbossa!
To freedom.
You did n't tell commodore norrington everything.
We'd best drop canvas, sir!
Blast it, i'm already awake!
We're not going to just surrender!
Sir! shall i break out the cannons?
This dock is off-limits to civilians.
What's your name?
But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
You threatened miss swann.
You cheated.
Move away.
No.
Why ask me?
Because you're a pirate.
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
I can get you out of here.
Agreed.
Not without my effects.
I'd die for her.
This is either crazy, or brilliant.
Is that so?
That's not true.
I swear, you look just like him.
It's not true my father was a pirate.
Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
Tortuga?
What's that?
Depends.
No.
Do you have any idea where you're going?
Are you certain this is the right way?
The black pearl is a real ship.
No, it's not.
Yes it is. i've seen it.
You've seen it?
Yes.
You've seen the black pearl?
Yes.
You have n't seen it.
... no.
No.
I think he's telling the truth.
He's not telling the truth.
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
He's still breathing.
Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
Commodore --
A moment.
But --
How long do you leave him in there?
Speak.
Wheelchair accessible.
Something to drink, dr. bright?
How apropos.
I know what you're doing.
Like rotting meat.
It's ready now, i know it is.
And you think o'brien is that leverage?
Why are there two <unk>?
Yes. yes, of course it is.
It will be an ascension.
I was wondering if you'd finished considering?
Considering what?
Poppy, please --
If you loved me like i loved you?
Where did he go?
Hey!
You do n't want this.
What did security say?
They'll in validate the key. probably nothing.
Well, you got another problem.
You were never invited to my house.
Is that what argon told you?
You're afraid of him.
Yes?
Smell? uh, something like <unk>.
Sir, please try to hold still.
When did you ...?
Been out for six months now.
Really? what have you been doing?
Somebody has to.
The big house?
And for cleaning up oil spills.
Nothing really worthwhile.
Yeah, we'll see.
Daniel, give him the trix.
Susie! you got ta help me!
They did it to me!
... just like the mouse.
My first <unk> was a lab mouse.
What happened to it?
Daniel!
We do n't have time for hysterics.
Got it.
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
That was an egg?
Three days ago it was.
That's right.
Is something wrong?
Susan!
Look at this!
What's that supposed to mean?
Just giving credit where credit is due.
You have no one to blame but yourself.
Just like old times.
Probably the caffeine.
Do you have something to bring me down?
Uh oh. i remember that temper.
What's wrong?
The nanobot ... it's not here ...
How far can you stretch?
What did you want my hair for?
That's pretty good.
That's going to fit me?
Did you go?
Where is it?
Argon's private lab.
Run, daniel! get out of here!
You saved my life.
We've got to get the nanobot.
It's too late. argon injected it.
That means the nanobot is still inside him.
You're not going after argon!
I remember i was trying to help ...
God, what a fight that was.
Things do change.
What? i'm not going anywhere!
All the different ways that i could kill you.
That's impossible.
Oh yeah, he's alive. technically.
And you have him?
Vermin ...
Icky!
What in the hell?
Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment.
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
Indeed? how interesting.
I think i better go, stew.
Do n't mind mother.
May i use your telephone?
Certainly. right over there.
I suppose you're going to print them?
Will you step into the library?
Will- uh- five thousand be enough?
For what?
I'm not going!

Huh?
So, you see how silly that rumor is?
Give my regards to your managing editor.
Oh, is that so?
Impossible. put it on again.
I bring a message from garcia.
Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
Look, i quit!
Yeah?
Yeah.
Gloria golden?
Right- for the first time this year.

Thanks, thanks.
Staring at us?
My mistake- she's glaring.
Well, gallagher! glad to see you.
Hello, stew.
Stewart, have you ever been to old madrid?
Been where?
To old madrid.
Never even been to new madrid.
Then how do you expect to write about it?
Oh- draw on my imagination, i suppose.
Did who?
Conrad.
Hey, gallagher!
Who was that?
Grayson- anne's lawyer.
A statement? good.
I have it here.
You quit trying to stop <unk>
Surely, come right in.

Yes- the worm!
Joan of arc! what's it to you?
There are no gentlemen on the tribune.
Well done, sir. very neat.
Smythe, the- er- gentleman is leaving.
Shhh! do you hear something?
Yes, sir.
You try it.

A bird in a gilded cage?

I did her hair.
What were you talking about?
And that was all?

Why
Because i have something very important to do.

Yes?
That was quick.
False alarm.

Hi!
Ann. hello.
Are you in the middle of something?
What are these?
Videotapes.
It's a personal project i'm working on.
Who's donna?
Donna was a girl i knew in florida.
You went out with her?
Because i enjoy interviewing women more than men.
All of these are interviews?
Yes.
Can we look at one?
No.
What ... what are these interviews about?
The ... interviews are about sex, ann.
About sex?
Yes.
What about sex?
Everything about sex.
You just ask them questions?
Yes.
And they just answer them?
Mostly. sometimes they do things.
I'm sorry this came up.
This is just ... so ...
Maybe you want to go.
John and cynthia have been ... `` fucking''.
I know.
You know?
Yes.
How did you know?
She said it on her tape.
Do you think that's such a good idea?
That's a good question.
What do you have to do to get ready?
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
I have money.
What will you do when the money runs out?
It wo n't. are you ready?
Tell me your name.
Tell me your name.
Ann bishop millaney.
Do you talk to him?
When we're making love?
Yes.
Sometimes. afterward.
Is he going to see this?
Did you have sex before you were married?
I guess not.
So you do fantasize?
Yes.
About who?
I fantasized about you.
About me?
No.
On tape?
No.
Ca n't.
You said you were n't always impotent.
That's correct.
So you have had sex.
Yes.
Who was the last person you had sex with?
So you lied to her?
Yes. i did. willfully and repeatedly.
Interesting analogy.
I'm babbling.
No, you're not.
You're really never going to make love again?
I'm not in love with you.
But if you were?
I ca n't.
Why not?
I've told you.
Who? elizabeth?
Yes.
You mean you're still in contact with her?
No.
But you're planning to be?
Not entirely.
But that was part of it?
Yes.
Like maybe a big part?
Do n't do that.
Why not?
I want to touch you.
Graham ...
John?
Who'd you have lunch with?
Something wrong?
But i'm not.
I'm not either!!

What?
I want out of this marriage.
Goddam right.
Bastard ...
You son of a bitch!!
I have thought about it, yes.
God damn you!!
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
What do you mean?
Did you masturbate?
Did you confront john about the visitor?
Is he still at your house?
No, he left last week.
Did you find him attractive?
What do you mean, like physically?
Yes.
That you are under no obligation to me?
Yes.
Do you want to leave therapy?
I hate my sister.
Uh-huh. so what's he look like?
Do you have to say that?
Ann, you always underestimate me.
He does n't have a phone.
Well, i'll call him when he does.
But he wo n't.
And what?
A card? for her fiftieth birthday?
Will you stop? jesus.
No, i did n't.
Why not?
Because i never got around to it.
No, it's nothing like that.
Well, what? is he dangerous?
No, he's not dangerous. not physically.
Well, what, then?
I do n't want to talk about it.
Then why'd you call me?
He just asked me questions.
What kinds of questions?
Questions about sex.
Apparently.
Yes, i did.
Cynthia!
What!?
Why did you do that?
Because i wanted to.
But why did you want to?
He would n't do that.
Did he touch you?
No, but i did.
In front of him, ann, yes.
I ca n't believe you did that!!
I do n't want to discuss it.
Here it is.
What is it?
It looks like a <unk>.
I was just trying to --
So what's my share of the dress?

And that's all?
Yes.
How do we start?
I turn on the camera. you start talking.
And you ask questions, right?
Yes.
No.
Do i sit or stand?

She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
I just ... ann is very ...
It wo n't. i trust him.
Did he put you up to this?
Who?
God, you ... you're mean.
Plenty of room for two people.

It's been a while.
You've got a legitimate job.
Yes, sir. you would n't believe it.
You got a place to stay?
What brings you into my saloon?
Nothing like that will happen between us.
I took out thirteen dollars.
This is a lot of money.
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
It is that.
Easy, boy. just an idea.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
I'm going to have to look into this.
Yeah, maybe i will too.
Yeah. bad luck. good-bye, cobb.
Stella.

You really are a gambler.

No need. she does all her own stunts.
Even the fall from the plane?

Everyone i know has met her, viktor.
Everyone you know is lying.

Let me do it, hoffy.
You want to go?
Sergeant hoffman from barrack 4.
Yes, sir.

What about schulz?
Stay out of it, sefton.

You starting that again?
How do they know?
You told them, hoffy.

Nun? was ist? haben sie's <unk>?
Who's the guy, schulz?
I do not want those cigarettes.
I'll make it five hundred!
Talk what? i do not know anything!
Just get us a couple with big <unk>.
Did i interrupt something, gentlemen?
Yeah. we were just passing out guns.
From a chicken, <unk>.
Is it all right if we smell it?
Have a nice time over there?
So you're stuck with me, eh?
The captain would make a much more valuable hostage.
It's working.
I thought he was the chief engineer.
He is.
Target their bridge.
This is its current position.
Population?
Well?
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
I get it. i get it.
That's it, <unk> we're all out!
We're within range, sir.
Deck 15, section <unk>.
Soran?
All of us.
Where is he now?
Guinan, can i leave the nexus?
Why would you want to leave?
Can i?
Yes, where would you go?
Well, may we have a look around?
No, no. thank you.
We do n't have a tractor beam.
Beautiful day, is n't it?
Better?
Captain of the enterprise, huh?
That's right.
Close to retirement?
You know, scotty, it amazes me.
But i do have a theory ...
A photon torpedo?
Keep her together until i get back.
Sir?
You want me to contact starfleet?
Is there a problem?
No, sir.
Understood. that will be all.
Sir, is there anything wrong?
That's a pretty big margin of error.
Captain, are you all right?
Or perhaps they're on the surface.
You must think i'm quite the madman.
The royal ... studs?
It looks like we're too late.
They have found a way to penetrate our shields.
Transwarp at your command, sir!
Put me on the hailing frequency.
Shall i alert dr. mccoy?
Response?
What did you see, chekov?
Sir, the shields ... non- responsive.
Aye sir, coding now.
Locate.
Surge from astern, sir. aft quarter!
I do n't believe it ...
Hello, sir. it's david.
David! ... what went wrong?
Same sector. metallic mass.
Underground deposit?
Approximately two meters long ... <unk> in form ...
New orbit commencing ... coming up on sector three ...
Check for trace radiation. infrared enhancement.
I'll handle that later.
. .. spock's tube ...
What is it?
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
Not exactly.
Why?
It was the only way to solve certain problems --
This planet is aging in surges.
Whoever they are, they're getting closer.
Steady ... steady ... all right, mr. scott.
Mr. scott, all power to the weapons systems --
How many more?
Admiral, this is lieutenant saavik.
The genesis planet is gone.
My god ...
I know you ... do i not?
You would have done the same for me.
Yes, yes, spock ...
Count on our help, sir.
... we have cleared <unk>.
Warp speed, mr. sulu ...
Estimating genesis <unk> hours, present speed.
That distortion is closing rapidly ... opinion, sulu?
... a cloaking device?
About a dozen officers and men.
Sir, planet core readings unstable ... changing rapidly ...
What about surface life signs ...?
Close ... there --
Gentlemen. good evening.
Good evening, commander. everything ready?
Welcome aboard, admiral.
You're right. thanks for the drink.
None
Wait! give me a chance --
<unk>. prisoners are at beam coordinates. standby ...
You should take the vulcan, too.
No.
But, why?
Genesis, i want it.
Give me your hand and we both live.
He would not have spoken of it openly.
... he spoke of your friendship.
Yes ...
He asked you not to grieve ...
... yes ...
... the needs of the many outweigh ...
... the needs of the few ...
... or the one.
Share this with no one.
Success, my lord.
I ordered no interruptions.
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
Range: 3000 kellicams.
Firing range, sir.
1,000 kellicams, closing!
500 kellicams!
You amaze me, commander.
Physician, heal thyself.
That's all you have to say?
But i'm allergic to retlax.
Amazing! i do n't know what to say --
Say thank you.
And who am i hiding from?
Shore leave, admiral.
Now that's what i call a meal.
You okay, jim? how do you feel?
... ca n't read you ... repeat ...
Repeat ... what's wrong? what's wrong?
... taking genesis away from us ...
Carol!
David --
Jim --
You're crazy --!
But the child --
Where's dr. marcus --
It's a long story.
It's the genesis wave!
What?
He's on a build up to detonation!
How soon --
We encoded four minutes --
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
Let go -- he ca n't --!
What are you looking at?
The admiral's son.
Do n't you believe it.
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
Let them eat static.
Sir -- our shields are dropping!
Departing dark side, regula.
We'll lose them if they go in there.
Tactical!
Inoperative.
Yours ... is ... the superior ...
Time's up, admiral ...
Aye, sir.
We'll be going to warp speed --
Just barely, sir.
Uhura. ca n't you augment?
She's not responding ...
Try the emergency channels ...
Enterprise to reliant. come in, reliant.
Mr. scott on discrete.
On screen.
Admiral --
... no response, sir.
Give the word, admiral.
Mr. scott, the word is given.
Meaning you ca n't even beam us back?
Your first training voyage, mr. preston?
Is the word given?
The word is given: warp speed.
There's a first time for everything, admiral.
How far?
Carol marcus --
It literally is genesis ...
The power of creation --
What's she doing here?
Is it possible their comm system has failed --?
The prefix code?
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
That's it?
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
Spock!
The ship -- out of danger?
... the good of the few ...
In my quarters, uhura.
Uhura! what's happening? damn it ...
Permission to speak <unk>, sir?
And why not?
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
You earned it.
Yes.
This is damned peculiar. yellow alert.
Khan!
Reliant's command ...
Indeterminate life signs.
That was close --
Hold your course. look sharp ...
Mr. saavik, all stop.
All stop, sir.
Cease fire. look sharp.
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
Time from my mark ...
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Time!
Three minutes, thirty seconds.
Understood, sir.
Admiral on the bridge!
Stop engines.
Course plotted for regula i, admiral ...
Mr. sulu ... the shields!
I ca n't get power, sir!
Approaching regula and space lab regula i.
Admiral on the bridge --
Phaser lock inoperative, sir.
Leaving section fourteen for section fifteen.
Project parabolic course to avoid entering neutral zone.
I'm aware of my responsibilities, mister.
Shields activated!
Aft thrusters, mr. sulu.
We are clear and free to navigate.
Prepare for warp speed.
Fire all phasers ...!
He's not what i expected, sir.
What did you expect, lieutenant?
Very well, mr. saavik, clear all moorings.
All moorings are clear, captain.
Take her out, mr. saavik.
Lieutenant, the admiral is aware of the regulations.
Certainly ...
You lied.
I do not understand the final question ...
You are half human. the computer knows that.
Where must you go?
To earth. to offer testimony.
You do this -- for friendship?
Humans make illogical decisions ...
Heard there was some excitement.
How're you doing?
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
You sure this is such a bright idea?
It'll come back to him.
Are you sure? that's what i thought.
-- that's the general idea.
What did you say she was getting?
Wake up, man, wake up!
Hi ... busy?
You're joking ...!
That is what i said, doctor.
Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.
Naturally. so what is your problem?
... best shot ...?
Guess, spock. your best guess.
`` guessing'' is not in my nature ...
You're saying ... it is a compliment.
We're just -- observing.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
I have the coordinates of the reactor ...
The top of what?
Name?
I do not know your name.
You play games with me and you're through
Shields, mr. chekov.
No choice now, scotty!
Ah, well done, team 2.
And admiral, it's the enterprise.
Cloaking device is stable ... all systems normal.
Can you protect us?
I suppose they told you that ...?
So you were at berkeley.
You sure you wo n't change your mind?
We do n't want to be any trouble.
Do you trust me?
Just lucky, i guess.
You're upset about losing the whales.
... you're very perceptive.
Where could you take them?
What's that?
... who are you?
All right. the truth?
It would n't be my first choice, no.
Here ... in the park?
Kirk. they're gone.
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
You tricked me.
Oh my god, we're too late!
You mean this is -- goodbye?
Permission to come aboard.
Permission granted.
Thank you, admiral.
Mr. spock, your computations?
In progress, admiral.
Ready to engage computer, admiral.
What is our target in time?
The late 20th century.
You've programmed that from memory ...?
There is a 20th century possibility.
Where would we find these reactors ... theoretically.
How do you know this ...?
As you observed, a primitive culture.
Yes.
Spock ...
The hell i ca n't
I believe i was successful in communicating our intentions.
Status?
Admiral. full power is restored.
Spock ... did braking thrusters fire?
They did, admiral.
Warp two ... three ...
Mr. sulu ...? ... mr. sulu?!
... aye sir ...?
What is our condition?
Sir ... braking thrusters seem to have fired.
Ready sir.
Advise reaching 10,000. steer three-one-zero.
Three-one-zero, aye!

Admiral, i am receiving whale songs.

Any luck ...?
Uhura! ... where!
Bearing <unk>, range 600 nautical.
Estimate range, ship to whales!
I ca n't, sir -- nothing!
Scotty, how long is this bay?
Two?
They're giving out. <unk>.
Full power, sir.
The whales ...?!
No power to the bay doors.
Go on ahead ... close the hatch!
I am well, admiral.
Professor scott, if you'll --
With pleasure.
Well, that's different.
If you'll follow me, professor --
I will. can my assistant come, too?
I notice you're still working with <unk>.
Hello? computer ...?
Just use the keyboard ...
Transparent aluminum?
Hi. huey <unk>, is n't it?
Why?
I do n't like to leave questions unanswered.
But not you.
... an offlander?
Mother and son. you arranged this ...?
You're what?
I understand.
Do n't you ever get tired?
Really?
Chase me!
Androids ... do n't have ... fun.
Why not ...?
<unk> will take you the rest of the way ...
I have to go home now.
Can he breathe under water?
Data does n't breathe.
Wo n't he rust?
Very funny ...
She's stabilizing.
Is it safe to move her?
Hello, data ...
Captain, geordi ...?
Yes ... that looks like them.
A ship,
It is clearly federation in origin, captain.
How many?
Will the structure hold if we blast through?
It is not over.
Understood.
May i talk to you alone?
They ... are in opposite directions, sir ...
I do n't believe it happened that way.
Implants bothering you?
Will that stop the tear?
You got me, commander.
We're pulling it like a zipper across space ...
Options?
I do n't think they believe us.
How long'til they reach us?
They're <unk> their forward weapons array.
'yew-cheen chef-faw.'
Who is it?
Deck five.
Prepare the ship for departure at <unk> hours.
You must be planning on doing some hunting.
Would you like something to eat?
Worf to picard ...
Yes ... yes, i ... can hear you ...
Captain ...
Come out, come out wherever you are ...
Direct hit. he's resetting his shield harmonics ...
The <unk> sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
No, sir. it is a gorch.
Isolinear tags. their transporters can lock onto them.
One. it's ru'afo.
... population three hundred million ...
What are they interested in ...?
Wine, women and song.
Why would we be involved with these people?
You have n't done that in a long time ...
What ...?
What you're doing to my neck ...
This is n't one of the usual therapeutic postures ...
But it's comfortable.
Why do n't you try sitting up?
Or you could try lying down.
... i believe you ...
Augh.
Augh?
Initiate launch sequence.
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
Absolutely.
Cochrane ... the inventor of warp drive?
Not yet.
How long has he been unconscious?
Is n't it better like this ...?
Vulcan?
Can you <unk> it?
I believe so.
We are approaching the terran system, captain.
I have helm control.
The vortex is collapsing, sir.
Who are you?
Where's the battery room for the hospital?
I told you, there's no --
This must be it.
Ready to make a little history?
Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms ...

Active.
Main bus ...
Jean-luc picard.
Great name. french?
Yes.
Where are you from most recently?
You seem to have an answer for everything.
Something wrong with that?
What do you want?
The invasion plans.
There is no invasion ...
What?
You're lying.
Friends from cornell ...
Some.
We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
You're leaving, are n't you?
I have to ...
Where? and do n't tell me san francisco ...
That's impossible.
Incoming transmission from the borg.
Life signs?
Track their weapons fire.
Port battery, ready sir!
Hull integrity down to thirty percent ...
Target locked!
Incoming transmission from starfleet command. admiral hayes.
Report.
We're still in earth orbit.
Looks like they damaged the silo ...
Life signs?
Return to our own time?
Unless you'd like to stay.
A <unk> decompression has been initiated!
What are they doing?
They're <unk> the deflector power conduits ...
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications ...
We have to stop them from sending that message.
Agreed. options?
Are you alright?
Report!
We've lost bridge control!
Emergency override!
They're bypassing engineering ...
I remember it made me sick.
Worf to bridge.
What the hell happened down there, worf?
Mr. president.
I believe the operation is over.
You may need assistance, doctor ...
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed ...
Spock, that was actually funny.
Or not to be-
Uh, jim ...
What the hell's going on?
Can you-?
Thanks ...
Figures.
We're not finished.
-< u> kobayashi maru< /u> ...
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
That was the general idea i intended to convey.
I did n't mean this future.
What is it with you, anyway?
Still think we're finished?
Jim, leave me- i'm finished ...
If they're even looking for us ...
Damned clever if you ask me ...
Absolutely not!
This is fun ...
Too bad we ca n't smell her.
Are you carrying a surgeon?
We were until your torpedoes!
Stand ...?
Was chancellor gorkon alive when you first examined him?
They'll respect him now ...
I've always wanted to meet you, captain.
Would you care to go topside?
You <unk> ignorance?
He's a doctor!
He just tried to save him!
I checked the data banks, yes.
And what did they tell you?
Are those your words?
Yes.
Spoken by you?
Yes ...
Louder, please. we can not hear you.
You were <unk> ...
Yes.
For insubordination.
You deny enterprise fired on kronos one?
Where is mr. sulu?
Just the size of my head-
Torpedo room --?
From starfleet?
She's here- somewhere.
Shields. battle stations.
They're preparing to fire.
What are we searching for, mr. spock?
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
Now we go to starfleet?
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
An incident?
Do we report this, sir?
Your friends are late ...
Is n't it about time you became something else?
What took you so long?
Kill him! he's the one!!
He wants your obedience to the brotherhood of aliens.
He's got it.
How did you know ...?
We do n't get many presidential assassins.
Except us.
I know how to get outside the shield.
Stand down your weapons.
This is incredible-
Aft thrusters-
Aye, sir.
Plot a course for kronos, lieutenant.
Kronos, sir?
I'm still in the chair, lieutenant.
Sorry-
You piloted well out of spacedock, lieutenant-
I always wanted to try that.
I hope you're happy.
Sir?
Captain, our shields --!
Just the prototype.
This is captain sulu, uss excelsior.
Sulu!
When does this conference start?
According to my information, today.
Thank you, captain sulu.
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here-
Do n't trust them. do n't believe them-
They're dying.
Never been this close.
What is it?
I am uncertain.
Spock, i'm really tired ...
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
Where?
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
What the-
Captain ...
The peace conference.
Why would they give them to us?
But i am not human. i am only-
Control tower, reading, sir.
Captain --
Gorkon's own man??
You must have faith.
Her own father ...?
Any reply from starfleet to our dispatch, lieutenant.
A lie?
A lie?
If you are logical.
I do n't want to.
Direct hit-
Trouble?
Sir?
You having hearing problems, mister?
I have confirmed the location, sir, but ...
What is it?
Praxis?
A computer canna lie, sir.
That could take hours!
Nevertheless.
And if they're still in place?
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
Fuzzy face is gone.
Do you know who i am?
Do you know where you are?
Can you remember our father?
No.
Why?
Because you are dangerous.
I do not understand.
No. can i move now?
No. i must deactivate you.
For how long?
Indefinitely.
Beverly, come in.
Remember him?
Is he very much like you were?
So ... to happy endings.
Now, you make a toast.
To new worlds ...
He is very observant.
Data!
A bit less <unk>, data.
A weapon.
It'll only work for one of us.
Yes, sir.
Ready, captain.
Of you?
We are being hailed.
Negative.
You have a red shirt.
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
How many of you did dr. soong make?
An individual more like you, you mean.
What is our <unk> distance?
It appears to be ... ... an arm.
It's you.
If you would n't mind.
May i have this dance?
Counselor.
Do you have a moment, sir?
I'm going to miss you.
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
How can you be certain?
But how can he? he'll kill you.
<unk>. this is so good.
No.
Do you have life support?
None
What's he doing?
Sir?
Aye, sir.
Deanna, on my mark.
How long until he can fire?
Sir, we're being hailed.
I'll take care of it, sir.
Admiral janeway. good to see you.
None
Understood.
None
Not with the romulans.
None
Just lucky, admiral.
Enterprise. we are the reman warbird scimitar.
I wo n't do it.
To find the head, sir?
Sir, i recommend we raise shields.
No!
Captain!
We're being hailed.
Sir, we're being hailed.
What's this?
We have to assume he had romulan <unk>.
It's working.
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
Not very chatty.
Strength in numbers?
Serving with you has been an honor.
And you're not as we imagined you.
Praetor?
And the senate supports you?
You know i need to verify this.
It's not quite the face you remember.
You're doing this to liberate the remans?
You do n't trust me.
Looking up at the stars.
After you, praetor.
So i'm not as tall as you expected?
I always hoped i would hit two meters.
With a full head of hair.
Shinzon ... i'm trying to believe you.
In time, jean luc.
Hello, jean luc.
Why am i here?
Long ago.
I do n't know.
That's your life ... not mine.
Please.
I hope you're still alive, jean luc.
Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.
Target disruptors. destroy them.
What about picard?
Well, that sounds relaxing too.
So they抳e got him up and running.
He's a very unusual android.
My god ...
Intruder alert!
Are we prepared?
The bond is broken.
Find her again.
No -- this is wasting time.
How long?
How long until we reach the rift?
What?!
Praetor ...
They're holding position.
And?
How many <unk> will you need?
The scimitar will serve my needs.
But surely ...
Then perhaps you will <unk> en us?
Praetor.
None
Benny, god, take it easy ...
Right in line with that burning tree.
What did i tell you?
Do n't you think you should call a backup?
Gate three. it's boarding now.
Thank you.
What can i do for you folks?
You have one with two beds?
Sure.
Credit card.

Where's that?
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
It's real, george.
It's taken on a disguise.
The extraterrestrial now looks like this.

I do n't want you to be hurt.
Where are you going?
I must meet my ship.
Why ca n't we wait here for a ride?
Asshole!!
Where did you learn that?
We're not going to get a ride tonight.

Jesus lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
Bullshit!
This has always been my favorite time of day.
Can you see under the faceplate?
Was there visual contact?
No, sir. radar.
It was only an accident that we discovered them.
You married, major?
Twenty-eight years.
To the same woman?
It was a man though ... right?
I told you ...
Is there a reward in this?
Hello ...

Forget her.
What's that? present from faith?
My god, lenny. what is it?
Black. jack.
And gives it to you.
But that does n't add, does it.
No it does n't.
That's where it gets a little strange.
And what about the guy that was following me?

What is it?
You better keep a low profile for a while.
Shit!
Take it easy. the glass is bullet resistant.
This is bad.
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
Those two guys were cops.
Well, look at the plus side.
He's totally cut off from the outer world.
You see tran?
Alright. we're going up.

Then we'll be right where we are now.
Hey, lenny. we made it.
Well ... get going. you're still bleeding.

From the grave?
Its called insubordination.
I'll take it into consideration.
You feeling okay, agent mackelway?
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
I do n't believe this.
I'm hesitant to ...
Why did you go to chicago?
I was visiting an old college friend.
I was looking for a pattern.
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
I did n't use low's name.
He's got you believing in zero now too.
I need to get to amarillo immediately.
How long have you been downtown?
You work with koessler?
And who kills in the manner of his victim.
That information's being withheld from the media.
Some kids found you in a garbage dump.
Yes i do.
The man knew how to dress.
The other reason?
And one other thing.
What's that?
He thinks he looks young.
Why did koessler assign you as my liaison?
Because you asked him to, stupid.
`` <unk> fraternizing.''
It's a no-no.
I know.
I've been thinking about this.
Does koessler ask about me?
He's called a couple times.
What did you tell him?
Just routine stuff.
Not about coming to see daitz?
We got an unsub walking around with four feet?
The tattoo?
Sue ann hanson.
That's true.
Then there's the other issue.
And nobody else can do that?
Hello?
Jaime? where are you?
Where are you? everybody's looking for you.
Start killing people for real?
Suspect zero.
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
I guess i'm a little paranoid.
Slow down a second, you met with low --
You were right. he found me.
You okay?
Yeah, of course.
All the same killer?
I have n't changed anything. damn.
I ...
Jaime --
What happened?

Al malone wanted him out at the fawcett farm.
Why? did n't al believe my story?
He was calling from the farm, mrs. brenner.
Do you think cathy's all right?
What?
Yes, i'm sure she's fine.
Do i sound foolish to you?
Yes.
Would you like me to go for her?
I could n't ask you to.
I do n't mind, really.
That's the last of it.
Did you close the door?
Shhhh. shhhh.
That's a chimney swift, all right.
Thanks, al. we'll be all right.
Is that for mitch brenner?
Yes.
He's not home.
Well, where did he go?
Bodega bay. he goes up there every weekend.
I wonder if you could help me.
What?
Lovebirds.
No, of course not.
No, sir, those are ... <unk>.
Does n't what make me ...?
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
Are they moulting now?
Some of them are.
What did you say?
I was merely drawing a parallel, miss daniels.
I do n't know you.
Ahhh, but i know you.
How?
We met in court.
I think you're a louse.
That was the damndest thing i ever saw.
Do you practice here?
No, san francisco. what are you ...?
What kind of law?
Not everyone, miss daniels.
I'm sorry. who's your friend?
Why ...
Yes?
Annie. annie hayworth.
Well, well, small world. annie hayworth.
Yes.
How do you know annie?
So you came up to see annie, huh?
What did it say?
Right next to the one you already had.
Yes, but ...
You are, are n't you?
I'm sure.
Seven o'clock then.
Why did he shoot her?
He was watching a ball game on television.
What?
Oh, yes.
Will i be seeing you again?
So you did n't go to school together.
No.
You were lying.
I wrote the letter.
But you tore it up.
Yes.
Why?
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
Like jumping into a fountain in rome!
I told you what happened in rome!
Do you expect me to believe ...?
I'd still like to see you.
Why?
It is for me.
But not for me.
Cheers.
You have a job?
I have several jobs.
What do you do?
I do different things on different days.
Helping travelers.
And fridays? what do you do then?
Nothing. i go to bird shops on fridays.
What'll it say?
You'll think me very bold, sir.
Are you all right?
Do you want some mustard with this?
Some cream?
I'll take cathy up to bed.
Are you staying?
Really? tell me about it.
It's an uprising.
Of birds?
Hear!
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
Take wing!
What it was, probably ...
It's so damn quiet out there.
It was like that yesterday.
What do you mean?
Melanie, melanie ...
I'm frightened, mitch.
Melanie ...
I think it's safe to get out now.
Do n't let's take any chances.
The town looks clear.
The bay does n't.
Where are they heading?
Inland.
Santa rosa?
When will they stop?
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
What time is it?
Almost two a.m.
You must be exhausted.
The power.
Mitch ...
We'd better light some of those lamps.
Hello, miss daniels.
There we are!
That ... that ... who was that?
Have you got a pencil?
Yes, certainly.
Daniels. i think they were after the children.
For what purpose?
And what? vultures? hawks? eagles?
Sebastian, i'm not an alarmist.
Help how? what do you want to do?
How do you plan to do that?
We need them.
Not if they're starting a war.
Then let's go. now!
I fear he may have to.
You asked to see me, ma'am?
I want you to help my little girl.

I'm by way of being a medical myself.
Mr. fettes and i have professional matters to discuss.
I am the best man for the job.
It might be an interesting case.
You know something about the human body, gray.
The nerve centers -- the brain --

This is a gift.
I take no gifts from you.
This is a gift you'll not return.

What's this guy's problem?
Shit.
Wait here. i'll be right back.
Tripp?!
You stay there.
Kidnapped? by who?
His parents.
It's a little late to call admissions.

Which is?
So tell me about you and the chancellor.
So modest.
Crabtree.
Shut up, james.
Who do you think it is?
The chancellor's here? now?

Kind of a sign, you're saying.

Bullshit. it's mine, motherfucker.
You must be mistaken.

He did n't give his name.
Who?
The guy on the phone.
What'd you tell him?
Afraid so.
Washed up?
Professor tripp?
Hm.
How's that?
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
So where have you been staying?

She seemed to take it pretty well.

You're mad at me, are n't you?
Jealous? of me?
You're lying.

Professor tripp.
Chancellor.
I got the message you called.
You go first.

Yes.
Heavy. smells like gunpowder.
Pow.
You got me.

You heard? how?
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
Really? that was fast.
About the baby.
Who's that sitting in your car?
James leer.
Inside.
And the jacket?
Someone stole my car.

He told you.
He told me.
And what did you say?
I lost it all.
Oh, grady. you're such a putz.

Ouch. how many?
I went and looked at some babies just now.
Oh?
I guess you have to go on faith.
Did you tell walter?
I told walter.
Does he still love you?
You do n't deserve me, you know.
Why yes. how did you know?
That's a nice greenhouse.
I need a ride.
I'm not sure that's possible.
Listen, antonia --
He's writing his name in water.
You mean because his career's ruined and all?
Walter?
Who's this?
It's grady, walter.
Grady?
It's three-thirty, grady.
This is important.
Oh?

I'm in love with your wife.
Excuse me?
Is it good?
Who's that guy?
What exactly are we doing here, professor tripp?
Yo, traxler.

Holy shit. are you serious?
As a heart attack.
What made you pull out that old thing?
I was thinking of you.
Where you stand?
Neurologist? why? what's wrong?
A jockey? you mean, like --
Hardapple?
The perpetrator.
No, the dog.
I might have his number on campus.
Are you riding with me, james?
There's so many ...
You'd recognize it if you tasted it.
You want to keep him happy.
Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.
Yeah, you still with northland?

Carlos, i never raped a woman.
Carlos, can i ask you something?
Sure.
Nothing.
What do you mean?
What are you looking at?
Birds.
There's little chicks! you want to see?
They're starlings.
Is that right?
I do n't like starlings.
A solitary vireo. i like that one.
Their sound is quite musical.
How does it sound?
It's hard to describe.
Try.
I ca n't.
I'd love to hear it.
Something like that.
That was terrific.
You should hear the bird.
I have to go.
Do you come here often?
My daddy likes me home before dark.
See anything interesting?
What are you writing in that book?
Do n't you have friends?
I'm not pretty.
Hiya, walter.
What's up?
You do n't know?
I have no idea.
I think you do.
I have n't broken any laws.
Then you wo n't mind if i look around.
I would.
Got something to hide?
Does n't everybody?
Cherry?
Yeah.
It's not for sale.
Okay?
Too much sun.
You walked home.
Fairy tales?
Do you believe in them?
Woodsman?
The one with the ax?
You knew her?
What?
You do n't know?
I was asleep.
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
I was n't feeling well.
That's a nasty scratch on your neck.
I have a passionate girlfriend.
What's with the boxes?
You're a cop. figure it out.
I'd say you're moving.
The passionate one?
Yes.
Then i'd say you're a lucky fellow.
I count my blessings.
You sure you do n't know nothing about this?
So. how are you adjusting?
I'm adjusting okay.
And your new apartment?
Apartment's okay.
Are you taking your medication?
It gives me headaches.
But you are taking it?
Sergeant lucas. may i come in?
I'd keep away from him.
Have you seen walter?
Yeah, like the bird.
Can i ask how old you are?
I'm twelve.
Walter.
Do you have many friends?
No.
It sounds like you were banished.
Robin?
Yes?
What?
Would you like to sit on my lap?
No thank you.
Are you sure?
I'm sure. thank you all the same.
That's okay ... does n't matter.
My daddy lets me sit on his lap.
Does he?
Yes.
What's her name?
Ms. kramer.
Tell ms. kramer what your daddy does.
I ca n't.
But will he ...?
Your daddy will always love you.
I do n't want to hurt my daddy.
Walter?
No.
I do n't mind.
You should go home.
Ca n't i stay a little longer?
It's getting dark. go home.
And how's your job?
I'm not running for mr. popularity.
You seem a little hostile today.
What?
I'd like you to keep a journal.
A diary?
That's right.
No way.
Why not?
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
<unk>.
Oh. it never crossed my mind.
Of course.
It was just an idea.
Bad idea.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
Reflect.
That's right.
You think reflection is good.
It's very good, indeed.
Try it.
No fucking way.
How's the journal?
I'm still thinking about it.
You do n't like coming here, do you?
How do you feel about that?
I do n't feel anything.
Then why are you talking about this?
Have to talk about something.
Have you talked to carlos about your concerns?
I'm not that crazy.
Is that what you are angry about?
How long is this going to take?
We have a few more minutes.
I mean, when will i be normal.
We have a lot of work to do.
Will i ever be normal?
I could n't say.
You could n't say.
I'm afraid not.
Do you know what `` normal'' is?
I suppose it's however society defines it.
How do you define it?
They usually tell me.
How do they know?
What is your idea of being normal?
Fuck you, rosen!
I know --
You do n't know!
I do n't know.
What did you think would happen?
I do n't know.
What did you want to happen?
Walter, we'll pick up here next time.
I want to talk about it now.
You're very late.
Sorry.
Please do n't do it again.
When did it all start?
I do n't know.
That's not a helpful answer.
Close your eyes.
What?
I'd like you to close your eyes.
Why?
To relax.
I'm relaxed.
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
I do n't see --
Who do you see?
Not so fast.
Sorry. where is she?
In my bedroom, sleeping.
Where are you?
In my bed too.
How old are you and your sister?
We're little kids.
And what are you doing?
Just lying there. we're taking a nap.
What the hell are you doing there?
Do n't ever do that again.
All right.
This is garbage!
You felt pleasure.
Did you get an erection?
I was six years old!
It's going to take time, walter.
Time.
How do you feel about that?
What?
Are you okay?
Want a ride?
I'm all right.
There's something wrong with this picture.
What picture?
I'm talking about you.
Me?
What's weird about that?
Most women would n't choose it.
You're quiet at work.
I'm just quiet.
You do n't hang out with the other guys.
Neither do you.
You never spoke to me before.
Are you?
Southern light.
You plan to drink both those beers?
Is that a school?
K through sixth.
Does n't it get noisy?
What about bears?
What about them?
They could eat you.
What?
Something happened to you.
I'm not easily shocked.
I get that impression.
So ... what's your dark secret?
So?
So, you're not a dyke.
Hey, that was ... intense.
You're still here.
What's the problem?
You think i have a problem?
Do you?
It's been a while since ...
Tell me about it.
Maybe later.
How about in the morning.
The morning?
I thought i'd stay the night.
Did i say something wrong?
I suffer from insomnia.
Hey, there.
Why do you want to know?
What's the worst thing you ever did?
The worst?
So, what did you do?
I molested little girls.
Molested little girls?
You're not joking.
Look, you can go now.
Sorry.
What did you do to them?
It's not what you think.
I never hurt them. never.
Why do n't you just go now, okay?
What?
Get your kicks somewhere else.
Hey, i'm not --
Depraved? my mistake.
What was prison like?
You do n't really --
I've changed.
Is it their innocence? their beauty? ...
Their power. they seduce me.
They seduce you?
I was always the one seduced.
And what do you tell yourself now?
Nothing. it's over.
You know, this is crazy.
What?
Being here, with me.
I know.
Most people say the odds are against me.
What odds?
I got poked around ... here and there.
Which brother did this?
All three -- in chronological order.
You must hate your brothers.
I love my brothers.
You never asked them about it?
Are you serious?
Not ever?
Maybe this is n't a good idea.
What?
You're scared.
I'm not scared.
Neither am i.
We should live together.
Live together.
It's a bad idea.
Just think about it.
I've got problems.
Who does n't?
Most people do n't have my kind of problems.
Guess that makes you pretty special.
I say we call it quits.
What's this?
Thank you.
Do n't be scared, walter.
I'm not scared.
Do n't do that.
Do what?
Sneak up behind me like that.
What's your fucking problem?
What's going on?
I did n't sleep well.
Do you want to talk about it?
You okay?
Yeah.
I heard they were filthy birds.
Right through the brainpan. deader'n dogshit, boss.
How you guys doing?
You got it?! you got it?
Nice shot, lins.
Where are we?
Lord almighty.

But what did he see that made him panic?
What do you think he saw?
Hey, lins ... i'm glad your here.
Jesus, lindsey --
You dumb jarhead <unk> --
I think it likes you.
He's jammed the mechanism.
You owe me one, virgil.
You totaled it, huh?
It's flooding like a son of the bitch.
Well, that's that.
Good hundred yards, i'd say.
You see where it's coming in?
Son of a bitch!
How?
I do n't know how!
Do n't argue, goddamnit, just --
Oh god, lins ... i --
Hey ... big boys do n't cry, remember?
No, bud, no ... not you.
Hello, brigman.
We'll go in through that large breach.

Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
Got it. over.
He's convulsing!

You better not say you missed that.
Quiet! quiet!

And have you any other truths to tell me?

Has she ever spoken to you about me?
Where are you going? ... to montaldo's?

Yes, you should go.

Then i'll see you later.

No, sandro ... please ...
Why?
Are n't you going to change?
Sandro, i'm not coming down.
Why?
Good night, my love.
Good night. tell me that you love me.
I love you.

After god ... before the <unk> basket.

Agnes ...
Did your mother see angels often?
No.
Do you?
No.
Do you believe she really saw them?
No, but i can never tell her that.
Why not? mmm?
Agnes, did you love your mother?
Yes.
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
I could never be a mother.
Why not?
A mistake ...
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
A mistake ... it was a mistake ...
I ca n't help it if i'm stupid.
... that you do n't remember getting pregnant ...
I was a mistake.
What the child?
Everything ... i do n't have children.
I'm not sick.
Agnes ...
Answer me! you never answer me.
What did you do?
I'm always bad.
What did you do?

I'm frightened.
Of what?
How did you have a baby?
It came out of me.
Did you know what was going to come out?
Yes.
Did you want it to come out?
No.
Why?
Because i was afraid.
Why were you afraid?
Because i was n't worthy.
To be a mother?
Yes.
Why?
It grew.
What made it grow? do you know?
Yes.
Would you like to tell me?
No.
Did anyone else know about the baby?

We went to chapel for vespers.
What is it?
Someone's following me.
Who?
My bed.
What else?
A wastepaper basket.
Do you know who put it there?
No.
What do you think it's there for?
For me to get sick in.
Are you ill?
Yes.
What do you feel?
I feel as if i've eaten glass.
What do you do?
Which one?
I do n't know which one
Who?
Go away, i do n't want you here.
Is someone in the room with you?
Frightened.
Do you remember what just happened?
Agnes, can you hear me?
She said michael.
And the passage to the barn?
Yes.
Why?
So i could go to him.
Who?
Him.
How did she know about him?
She'd seen him too.
Where?
From the belltower the day she before she died.
So she sent you?
Are you frightened?
Not your fault ...
Agnes who did you see?
I hate him ...
Of course you do. who was it?
I hate him for what he did to me.
Yes.
For what he made me go through.
Who?
I hate him.
It was dead.
It was alive was n't it?
Mother miriam was with you was n't she?
Yes.
She took the baby in her arms?
Yes.
You saw it all did n't you?
What did you do?
I put her to sleep.
Agnes? who? mother superior?
???
What?
Look into the convent records.
Eve, she strangled a baby!
Why?
Larry ...
Marty, what are you doing here?
Something they ... that they overlooked.
What? you think that the girl is innocent?
I do n't know.
Thanks.
Martha, it's you.
You have proof?
I'll have it.
When?
No, no, no ...
I can get you new evidence next week.
Hello, mama ... brought you something.
Shut up, i'm trying to watch this.
It's your favourite ...
Who are you?
I thought <unk> was your favourite.
Who are you?
Oh that one there, in the corner.
The one up on the third floor?
Yes.
Who told you this?
Do you still go to church?
Yes ... i ...
You can call me sister.
You were a smoker?
Two packs a day.
Who knew about agnes' pregnancy?
No-one.
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
She undressed alone ... she bathed alone.
Is that normal?
Yes.
Who was the father?
I have n't a clue.
What man had access to her?
None as far as i know.
Was there a priest?
Yes, but i ...
Could there have been anyone else?
Obviously there was.
What's your opinion?
So, someone else could have done it.
No ... not in the eyes of the police.
And in your eyes?
It's possible is n't it?
That's absurd!
Shortly after she came to us.
And you were n't shocked?
I was appalled, just as you are now.
And what happened?
This was before her pregnancy?
You hate us do n't you?
What?
Nuns ... you hate nuns.
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
Then help her.
There's another choice.
<unk>.
All right, what do you need.
When would agnes have conceived the child?
Oh, some time in january.
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
Earthquakes?
Visitors to the convent.
Yes.
There's nothing here.
Was the child full term?
Oh, dear god ...
What is it?
The sheets ...
What sheets?
You lied to me
About what?
Like keeping her home from school?
Yes.
Do you know what she did to her?
I do n't think i care to know.
She molested her!
I knew that after the fact.
Why did n't you do anything to stop her?
Because i did n't know ...
And my permission?
We'll see about that.
Do n't deny it!
I have n't decided yet.
The woman's health is at stake.
Because i am a moral person.
Bullshit!
Bullshit yourself!
Catholic church does n't have a corner on morality ...
Who said anything about the catholic church ...
No, it reminds me.
Would you like one? huh?
I'm out of <unk> ... ... practice.
All right?
Hand rolled.
Even christ would partake socially.
Saint peter?
Pipe!
Mary <unk>?
Oh, you've come a long way baby.
Do you think they ever existed?
Yes i do.
Do you want to become one?
Do you think agnes is still attached to god?
Listen to her singing.
I'd like to begin.
The <unk>. do you still disapprove?
Would it stop you if i did?
May i be present?
Of course.
For the church?
For agnes.
You think she's a saint?
The father!
Who is he?
Why must he be anybody?
How?
Do n't be ridiculous.
Oh, would you stop lying mother!
I'm concerned about her health.
This is permission to take her apart.
Where is she?
Has n't she had enough?
I have a few more questions to ask her.
Who knew she was pregnant?
Why do you insist upon pressing ...
Was it you?
Is it because she's a nun?
Did you know she was pregnant?
Yes.
And you did n't send her to a doctor.
I did n't guess until it was too late.
For what? an abortion?
Oh, do n't be ridiculous.
The baby?
She did n't want any help.
You wanted that child out of the way.
That's a lie.
And the baby.
No!
I doubt that's what she'd say.
That's enough.
Agnes, what happened to the baby?
She ca n't remember.
Oh, do n't do this!
Lay them down.
Eh?
Lay them down.
We'd be thrown out.
They're yours.
They are?
Nine.
Bet you're only eight and a half.
Shurrup!
I bet you're -- sixteen!
Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
Well --

Give'em a pull.

Eh, have you got paul's grandfather?
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
Please, can i have one to surge with?
No.

This is your doing?
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
And you broke into that room?

Why did you break into that particular building?
It was the biggest i could find.
What was the real purpose behind this venture?
Enjoying our hospitality?

She's coming over here ...
She asleep?
Pictures from the play. jamie looks pretty --
And i have no idea why.
What if they expel you?
Kelly would n't do that.

Your father dropped off an extra check.
I do n't want his money.
It could help with a new car --
Out with belinda?
You look nice. i should have dressed.
You're fine like that, mom.
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
Thanks.
I have n't seen clay or eric lately.

I told him to leave me alone.
What are you doing here?
He wants to talk to you.

Landon!
Say nothing. nothing'bout her.
Who are you?
Landon carter. i was driving the car that --
You.
I'm very sorry --

'i hope your dreams come true.'
'is it really me?'
You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --

Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
Looking for intelligent life?
You're really into god, right?
In ten words or less?
Yeah.
My relationship with god is my own.
But you think about him -- it -- her.
You have to believe to have faith.
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
He does n't trust you.
The play's going to be really good.
You're not in a very good mood.
The play's in a couple of weeks.
Oh. just not at school ...
Yeah --
Or anywhere where people might see us.
Belinda's a very jealous person.
He okay?
You were great the other night.
I have n't been nice to you.
People can see.
Maybe you inspire me.
All of it.
It's not.
I do n't want to be just your friend --
It's a start.
So you're talking to me?
What does that mean?!
Hey.

Yes. but not as a date date.
Why not?
Is there a rush?
I have to get you home by one.
Your turn.
No.
Before we do this.
Excuse me?

Assholes. this happen to you?

Landon. i ca n't even do for myself.
But if you could, you would?
The carter boy. tell me about him.
What's landon carter up to?
Did you give him a gift?
It was a play.
Boys like him have -- expectations.
I'm asking how much.
You're in the play?
Reverend sullivan. can i ask you something?
Does it have to do with jamie?
I care for her.
This week.
Landon. you're not the quiet type.
No.
So talk to us about something.

Does she wear glasses?
No.
What's happening?
The one in brentwood.
Wait just a minute. our luck has changed.
Not a chance.
Do n't say that.
To hide it from the i.r.s.
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
Do n't talk. do n't talk!
Did you <unk> the phone?
No.
Did you hear that click?

They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
You're all three of you in that van?
Yes sir.
Yes.
It's locked.
Now i have -- it's a long story.
So far they're keeping their part of it.
You're not lenore oberfeld.
There is n't any such person.
The guy with the transplant.
Jack oberfeld in person. did you kill him?
You timed that beautifully.
Why pick me to be your `` mark?''
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
Who's in back?
A typical fuck-up.
You were at the emerald that night?
What's nels' number?
Do you think they'll walk away?
Yeah, i was waiting for that suggestion.
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
What's your point?
You're the man with the gun.
Naturally.
Naturally.
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
That's not good enough.
Some nice fantasy you all cooked up for me.
Took preparation.

You wo n't live to see it.
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
Thank god -- thank god i've got you.

Seems like it.
What's he doing? answer me!
Who am i talking to?
Who's this?
I thought you'd know me by now.
What does it take to kill you?
How far off are you?
Five minutes.
And make ourselves a hell of a target.
We're gon na get there first.
Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.
Who were you talking to?
Something was rattling around. some loose tools.
Who are you?
Let me talk to the lady again.
Can i make a quick call?
Government business?
What kind of treasury dept. business is this?
Undercover.
Scottish?
So can we consider you a regular, sir?
So let's call this the usual.
It takes all types.
So who's he?
He's what she should run a mile from.
Then why does n't she?
She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself.
You could always make it up to her.
She's not a girl, col --
See that, col?
See what, dil?
He gave me a look.
Just cut his hair, you know.
Yeah?
What you think?
Saw that one.
What would you call it?
He agreed that he was.
What do you think his name is?
That's what he said. jimmy.
He's still looking, col.
Persistent.
Good thing in a man.
An excellent quality.
Maybe he wants something.
Ask him.
He's back, col
Stop it, dil --
You see that, col?
Saw it, dil.
Fuck it, is what i say.
Yeah. fuck it, dil.
You fucking promised.
Did i?

See, they get the wrong idea.
Cunt. <unk> dyke cunt.
Hey, stirling fucking moss --
Sure, dave --
Take your clothes.
Fuck off back to <unk>!
Do n't chuck my clothes out!
Look, i'm sorry.
Do you mean that?
Do it on your own time, paddy.
What?
What's that supposed to mean?
How much did that frame cost, mr. franknum?
Two hundred quid, mr. deveroux.
Not in my experience.
I'm sure you do, mr. deveroux.
Someone recommend you?
In a way.
Who?
Guy i work with.
Does n't the water get to your nails?
What's it to you?
You american?
No.
No.
Scottish?
How'd you guess?
The accent, i suppose.
And what's it like?
That should make her happy.
Who's she?
Tell her i'm very happy with it.
Jimmy.
Everybody wants something.
You old-fashioned?
Hi.
What was that?
You all right?
Yes, thank you.
What was that all about?
He wants me to perform for him.
Perform?
You know.
You on the game?
He's getting up.
You want me to ask you in, right?
Give me that look again.
What look?
What's that about?
They're jealous.
Why?
You got a special friend, jimmy?
How special?
Jesus christ!
That dave?
Would you like a drink?
Yes, please.
What'll it be?
Someone out there.
Must be in love to manage that.
He lived here with you?
He was different.
How different?
As different as it's possible to be.
Tell me about him.
No.
Should n't i go?
No --
You want to know how i kissed him?
Yes ...
Are you jealous of him?
Maybe.
Do you miss him?
What do you think?
I think you do.
You say that like a gentleman.
Do i?
But you can t stay, you know that?
Did n't think i could.
Should n't you be in mourning?
Did he come here too?
Is this an obsession of yours?
Maybe.
He did sometimes.
So what do you want with me, jimmy?
Want to look after you.
What does that mean?
You mean that?
Drink.
What is this?
Ca n't leave me now.
Aha.
The thing is, can you go the distance?
Depends what it is.
What you thinking of, hon?
I'm thinking of your man.
Why?
I'm wondering why you keep his things.
Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?
Even now.
Tell him to stop messing dil around --
Dil --
Tell him it hurt --
Come on, dil --
Do n't call me that.
Sorry, darling.
Give it over, dil --
You could?
Do you care, jimmy?
Sure i do.
You mean that?
My, oh my, jimmy, how gallant.
Shut up.
Made me feel all funny inside.
I said stop it.
Ask me to meet you again, jimmy.
You think that's wise?
I did n't mean to hit you.
Kind of liked you as a girl.
That's a start.
So i'm sorry.
Make it up to me, then.
How?
Ask to meet me again.
Will you meet me again?
When?
Do they know?
Details, baby, details.
So they do know.
Do n't.
Sorry.
I should have known, should n't i?
Probably.
Kind of wish i did n't.
Are you pretending yet?
There's dave. he knew too.
Am i becoming <unk>?
A little.
Do n't ask me in.
Please, jimmy.
No. ca n't pretend that much.
I miss you, jimmy.
Should have stayed a girl.
Do n't be cruel.
Okay. be a good girl and go inside.
Happy now?
What?
He'd bring me carnations.
So i got it wrong, then.
Not at all, honey.
Do n't.
Come on.
Why, honey --
Come on.
You gon na tell me why?
Dil, this is jude.
It's her, is n't it?
What's her?
She's the thing you had to tell me.
Should n't be, dil
She own you, jimmy?
Yes.
She from scotland too?
You could say that.
And you're not going to tell me more?
What you doing, jimmy?
I'm not sure.
Do you like me even a little bit?
You do something for me, dil?
Anything.
You'd do anything for me?
Afraid so.
You want another haircut, baby?
You said anything, dil
A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
Why?
It's a secret.
You'd like me better that way, jimmy?
Yes.
And you would n't leave me?
No.
You promise?
You're no good at this, jimmy.
So it's true, then?
What?
You like me better like this.
Do n't call me that --
Why?
For me.
Why are we going here, jimmy?
I'm going home!
Come on ...
So tell me.
I was trying to get out of something.
You mean that?
You heard what i said, dil?
What pills?
Prescription. for my condition.
Are you supposed to take that many?
Are you all right, dil?
Good-bye, dil
Jimmy?

You knew which man?
Your soldier.

Thanks.
So he knows your name?
I told him.
Yes.
And do you know why?
You ok about that?

Would make me feel better about it.
You sure about that?
I'm sure.
So it was you all the time.
Who'd you think it was?
I thought it was dave.
And who's dave when he's at home?
He's at home.

Now, that was worth waiting for.
Hurry up, would you?
Now put it back in.
Fergus?
See? i was right about you.
Do n't be so sure.
Like what?
Who's dil?
My special friend.
Oh, yeah.
We got simple tastes, you and me.
We do n't look on it like that.
I've often wondered how you do it.
Depends on what you believe in.
What do you believe in?
That you guys should n't be here.
It's as simple as that?
I did n't.
She ca n't help it.
Dil was n't trouble. no trouble at all.
Do n't know her.
Want you to do something, fergus.
What?
If they kill me --
See if she's all right.
I do n't know her.

You felt obliged to.
Actually, you sing.
Pardon?
You sing. all the time.
What's this?

We took several photographs, there's no need.
You should come into the shelter.

Good.
You sew very badly.

It's a folk song.
Ouch! see- you're always beating me..!
Shall we be all right?
Why did you hold his collar?
Dance with me.
Why did he bring you?
We've got to get you out of here.
It hurts too much.
Why did you hate me?

Or my wife's.
Through a window.
The windows do n't open.
So he popped the pane?
You ordering chop suey again?
You got a better idea?
We've got to catch him in the act.
That's doable.
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
Yeah yeah yeah. what's the status?
We're getting close.
How close?
I do n't know, but close.
Gin? where the hell are you?
I have a question ...
Who am i?

How about if i try humility.
I do n't want to waste your time.
Then do n't.
You have a car?
Uh, yes.
Seems i am.
You disappeared.
You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
I've got something ...
You're not taking me seriously.
I did n't expect you to be so ...
So what?
Do you mind?
You're shaking. are you nervous?
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
But roki said --
You ca n't.
We going somewhere?
Possibly.
Maybe i should drive this time.
Very nice.
It's a test.
It's a fake.
Give him the card.
But --
He says they turned the card down.
Damn, i knew i forgot something.
Motorcycle.
It's one way.
We're going to die, are n't we ...
What about your bags?
Those are my clothes.
You stole my luggage? you --
I'm a thief. sue me.
That's entrapment.
And --
I'm impressed. ca n't spot a thing.
You're late.
And good morning.
Good morning.
I know it well.
Nice try. everyone thinks i did.
The rembrandt -- that was quite good.
On what? another job?
Why do n't we take oxygen?
Let's do it again.
Did i hear a car?
Our equipment has arrived.
I did n't mean to get personal.
A dozen times.
Got it.
Charged?
That's it. we're ready.
Thank you.
Certainly the most beautiful crook i've ever seen.
Are n't we early?
To us. to the mask.
You were afraid of heights?
He was n't.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
Camera in the --

We're working.
It's a party.
One, two, three ...
Ready?
Can you see the other <unk>?
They moved it.

Careful ... careful.
We did it.
Okay, you're a thief.
Stop! you're making ... mistake.
It's your mistake.
The big job.
What?
Your share.
We're living history here.
Hmmm ... 44 long.
You've got everything planned.
Oh my god, i thought --
What about the rules?
Transfer.
The eight billion. from them to us.
Peoples china bank.
The <unk>'s already programmed.
That's where the mask comes in.
So how long till we do this?
How do i look?
Pulse detectors.
Charged.
Parachute.
No way to take another day or two?
You should n't have.
Ca n't break tradition. it's bad luck.
You have something in mind?
That was a lifetime ago.
It was wrong to deceive you.
But would you -- would you --
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
Oh, i do n't care about the money.
Four billion dollars.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
Not for me.
The sign of our partnership.
Relax, do n't jam it ...
Move it, what are you waiting f ...
The door's the only way out!
Jesus.
Come on.
No way.
Hang on.

We need to make the trade tomorrow.
Which is --
In the van.
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
This is big enough.
Right.
Oh, it is.
It's too soon.
The early bird gets the damn worm.
So patience, <unk>, patience. trust me.
Remind me why.
You two make quite a couple.
We're supposed to.
You better not be taking on a new partner.
Suspicious, after all these years?
You damn well thought wrong.
Tonight your league night?
This is just show and tell.
I'm waiting for the tell part.
She's calling the shots now.
You know where my loyalties lie.
You're giving them to me?
Call it an expression of trust.
See you.
Probably not.
Oh, hell. i'm dyslexic.
Where've you been?

Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?
Uh-huh.

The extortion, the threats ...

And you were told to destroy those?
You come to the right place.
Pattee? that your middle name?
Nope. maiden.
You're married.

Much anger in him, like in his father.
The boy is our last hope.

You must survive, luke.
Ben ... ben ...

Growls a reserved greeting.
Barks a blue streak.
Three patrol ships are heading our way.

Han, we need you here.
We?
Yes.
Not you?
I take it back.
That star destroyer is slowing down.
I'm against that.
We've got to get out of this shower.

Who's staring?
You look silly.

To a lot of psychiatric small talk --
And we can watch ...

Is it a king or a queen?
It's a double.
Promise?
I'd like that.
Would you?
Really?
Lieutenant bedsoe?
What do you think?
You did n't see this. understand?
Did you find a sword? an old sword?
Tough.
It's not a homicide, lieutenant.
This ties in with nash.
He had to come from somewhere.
I think it was england.
Interrogation's over, bedsoe.
Detective bedsoe.
Lieutenant.
When did you get back?
Where were you last night around nine?
I already told you. i took a walk.
Tell me again. where'd you go?
No. i do n't scare easy.
Where have you been for the last seven years?
Around.
No.
Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
Must you do that?
What?
The river.
That's all?
I'm leaving.
Leaving what?
Maybe myself.
Thank you, thomas.
I'm sure they will.
France.
What are we doing here?
To ask her to dance.
She's the king's cousin.
Yes.
What worries you?
Well?
I'll go first.
No -- i will.
I stood up first.
That does n't matter.
You can go first.
It will be a good harvest this year.
Can you really tell from doing that?
What do you think?
I think my sarah fancies you, conner.
She's a treasure she is.
Agreed.
I would like to say goodbye.
How comes it your are not afraid?
And what would'st i gain from this bargain?
Your life.
We had a bargain. you promised.
Aye?
Where do you go when your mind drifts?
Different places.
The past?
I can not stay.
Why not?
Leaving? for how long?
Why?
I can not explain.
Do you love me, conner?
Aye.
Then take me with you.
Where i'm going you can not follow.
Huge.
I remember you.
I was wondering if i could talk to you?
Are you a cop?
No. i'm an archaeologist.
What do you want?
Yes. how did you know?
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
Bullet proof vests do n't bleed.
You're hurt.
Because it's my name.
Then who's russell nash?
You are a very persistent woman, miss hillman.
Why do you stare at me like that?
I do n't have any answers for you.
Who was that man last night?
I do n't know.
Do you always walk around with a sword?
I'm interested in mythology.
No.
Meet me <unk>'s at nine.
Good evening.
You're twenty minutes late.
You did n't answer my question.
I'm just trying to place you.
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
Is it?
Yes -- it is.
Have you told lieutenant bedsoe your theory?
No.
That would mean they'd been trapped in there --
Would you like to see it?
I've seen it.
You wanted the truth -- now you have it.
Where will you go now?
It will end tonight.
Must you fight him?
He's in there!
Be careful, conner.
We're holding the workers down below.
Why?
Someone broke into the cavern last night.
How could they get by him?
We found him this morning.
What's that next to him?
I do n't think it is a duplication.
It has to be.
You stayed here again last night?
I was working on the cataloging.
Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
Highlander -- i had hoped it would be you.
I am stronger than you, highlander.
That's what the kurgan said.
You know it's not safe here for you.
It is n't over, is it, conner?
No.
How can that be?
Is there anything else you need?
I'm glad you've come home, conner.
Would you care for some water, conner?
Do n't leave us, conner.
You kept it?
Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
I heard voices downstairs. is everything alright?
Fine.
Good afternoon, mr. parker.

You think we should take that chance?
You wo n't die if you let me help.

Not if they're looking at something else.
It's over. we have to give up.
Then we might as well die rich.
How about the cop?

Want one?
What do you want?

Kevin left without you.
Now we can do whatever we want.

Who?
Nix.
Nix?
Like in nothing. nobody. nix.
I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
How?
I hear mrs. swann's quite a babe.
You heard right.
Why?
My life was too weird for her.
That's butterfield ...
Take a look at this.
<unk>. d'amour. harry d'amour.
D'amour.

Death.
What about death?
Please.
I could scoop them out.
Do n't.
So tell me where nix is buried.
Anything?
Oh christ! oh christ!
What is he?
Do you wish him to be amongst us?
Yes ...
Will you come to him on your knees?
Yes ...
He's with us ...
Yes.
And are you afraid?
Please ... i was n't there ... ask pimm.
You do n't?
He's a secretive man.
Will you take the job, mr. d'amour?
Harry.
Harry.
He's good.
I do n't know where you'd start.
Well ... how about some of the other illusionists?
They wo n't tell you anything.
They were jealous of him.
Why? because he had you?
He ... did n't have me.. i told you-
So why did you marry him?
Okay. i'll keep digging.
Oh christ.
It was more than that, i think.
He was the real thing, right?
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
He taught all this to swann?
No.
You said you were n't with him for love.
I was n't.
Nothing's going to happen to you.
Nothing?
Are you sure?
And they all came ...
Yes.
What was that?
Harry?
Oh god!
I've got to help him.
No! no! no!

Valentin?
Good. there. yes?
Crank call. i'll get the number changed.
... they believe you.
Yeah. remember quaid?
Sure.
Somebody killed him.
Oh god.
Where the fuck is he?
And this butterfield guy --
-- vanished.
Trickery and divinity.
They were n't worth a damn.
Oh, i've got plenty.
With what?
Shit.
Mr. d'amour?
Go away.
It's one in the afternoon.
We've never met.
Then what do you want?
Whose is the car?
Mine.
Nah. you're driving it too carefully.
Maybe i just bought it.
Philip swann?
You know of him?
I saw him in vegas once.
What's the difference?
Any movie stars buried here?
I do n't think the dead much care.
Are you sure?
Who is she?
What the fuck are you doing here?
Looking for you. i tried the hotel.
What for?
Left alone? somebody's been murdered.
Yes. it's regrettable
Fuck regrettable! i want to know why.
What for? you need to stay busy?
I want to speak to dorothea.
I'm afraid she's not in.
I ca n't let you in.
Yeah, i know.
Leave her alone --
Are you satisfied now?
You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
I tried to pay you off.
D'amour --
Shit ...
Him too.
We've got to get you to a hospital.
Do n't bother.
Shut up. we've lost enough lives already.
I'm sorry, d'amour ...
Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
What's her problem?
She has no real grip on reality.
My god.
What?
You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
The puritan?
Yes ...
Where'd you learn that?
What?
That.
At birth. i do n't know you --
People are pretty cagey. who do you know?
For what?
For an introduction.
Look, ma, no wires.
You should n't have followed me, d'amour.
How the fuck do you do that?
Or murdered, like nix.
I did it for dorothea.
So nix wo n't come looking for her?
I do n't know what else to do.
Oh jeez.
You think i'm an asshole.
Did she know where nix was buried?
No.
Who else did? did valentin?
Yes.
They got here before us.
... no ...
That's where we're all going.
At a guess ... they just resurrected him.
This is where we killed him.
He did something with the ground.
Yes?
Can you do it?
I do n't know.
I got to go. i'm late.
Yeah. but not as cheap. call me.
A couple of weeks.
One question.
What?
Have we met before?
Maybe ... i ... do n't ...
What about philip swann?
He's not! he's not!
Nix! nix!
Is he the puritan?
Yes! yes!
Swann? what are you doing?
You could still help me do that.
Why would i want to?
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
Wait ... you still feel something for that bitch?
No!
Hello?

Oh.
You're possessive.
I'm stuck. does it get easier.
No, yes, it does ...
But, i'm mean.

We established that we have no communication.

John thinks i'm so snotty.
It's for my daughter.
How old is she?
Four.

I found them in your file box.
What a ... jerk!

What time did you make it for?
Yes.
And how would you describe him?
Your court order, dr. allen.
You know i'm not comfortable with this.
But your patient is legally entitled to it.
This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
Is he going to be okay?
Father, i have nowhere else to stay.
How're you doing? looking lovely as always.
What is it?
Something he said, just before ...
He spoke to you?

Do n't worry ... about the transformation, maya.
So ... we won?
We won because christ ... triumphed over satan?
You need his blood-type. like right away.
Well i know he's come here before.
What's his name?
Peter ... peter kelson.
You just call?
Two negatives always make a positive.
May i help you?
Peter kelson?
You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.
Not pure evil. that's correct.
So ... what did you think of the tape.
I think you gave me the wrong one.
We need to talk.
We needed to know all we could.
Get up!!
Peter, let go of the chair!
You okay?
When's your birthday?
There's nothing else here.
What's the bible for?
I'm scared i'm slipping back.
We're going to do this.
You have to say that.
No oxygen to the brain.
Plenty of time.
How much time do we have?
Hello?
I know who he is.
And what are you thinking we should do now?
I've filed a report with father frank.

Did n't know you cared so much.
That's it, give it your best shot.
With a jacked-up attitude.
Did n't know you cared so much.
I do n't.
See you made it.

How much?
Seventy a year.
Not bad, not bad.
How about yourself?
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
What?
You know what i mean.
Which one of us is she flirting with?
So? someone'll send it on ahead.
What are you doing?!
I'm getting dressed.
You've got three broken ribs, man!
She'll be worried about me.
She'll get over it.
Aye.
What's this?
It's a diary.
Be careful who sees it.
The place is a mess.
I ca n't move to tidy.
What's your name?
Mary taylor, sir.
Have i seen you up in balmoral, mary?
Checked and locked, sir.
Louder, girl!
Checked and locked, sir.
Hey, barney.
Mr brown, sir --
Yeah, yeah, i did.
Good man. and is she all right?
Yeah.
No doubt you've heard the rumors.
I take no account of gossip, your highness.
My concern is for the reputation of the monarchy.
It's the queen's decision.
I wish to see my mother.
She's busy.
Do you know who you address, sir?
Whom you address.
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
Yes, but is n't midnight a little excessive?
Mama ...
By whose authority?
We --
Checked and locked, sir.
How will i know?
I'm sorry?
How will i know what she requires?
You'll be sent a message.
Her highness' <unk>.
Do you?
No.
Go inside at once.
Is that the queen's request?
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
That can wait till the weekend.
There are important papers from --
I believe that decision rests with her majesty.
What do you know about the highlands?
I am a blank sheet.
Do you hunt?
Occasionally.
Dare say you can be taught.
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
I'm fine.
You're injured.
I'm not married.
Oh.
I would n't know.
Surely --
What i do, i do for my queen.
Was there never ambition?
Maybe, once.
Then i envy yo.
I do what i do.
For her majesty.
Aye.
But yourself? what about john brown?
I said. i serve the queen.
They do n't see it.
They are n't as <unk> as you.
Too busy looking after themselves.
The greasy pole.
No loyalty.
She'll never understand it.
In time, she will.
Mr brown.
Ma'am.
You are here safely.
Aye, ma'am.
You are well?
I am.
And the pony?
Your family sent cards. it was much appreciated.
Archie.
Yes. that will be company for you.
Mr brown.
Yes, ma'am.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
Aye, ma'am.
What are those?
What?
Are they worth reading?
I am told so.
Who by?
Sir henry ponsonby tells me they are charming.
What does he know about the highlands?
He has been attending at balmoral for many years.
We took a nip of whiskey.
To keep out the cold.
What is it, john? john?
John?
Yes, ma'am?
I was told you were in a fight.
Yes, ma'am.
Has someone seen to those bruises?
Ma'am?
Then why send me back to them?!
What can we do?
Then they may read about me.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
This is my good john brown.
Should we take it seriously?
The cartoon or her majesty's absenteeism?
Well, both.
The question is, do we need her?
So?
I see the prince of wales is here.
What did he want?
We're going to lose.
Who?
She's refusing to leave balmoral.
A fine choice, sir.
The queen wishes to publish an account of him.
Well, no rest for the wicked, henry.
We're expecting brown this afternoon, ma'am.
I'm sorry, ma'am?
Just them?
It's mr brown, ma'am.
What is he doing there?
Well?
Mr brown is unable to attend today.
Why?
I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
Unwell?
I understand he was in a fight.
How long has he been this sick?
A few days, ma'am.
Please make sure it does not happen again.
We were expecting you to return by six.
Read it.
Again?
Who told them that?
I have no idea.
There is one other matter.
What is it?
I have a letter, ma'am.
From whom?
Where is my son?
Prince albert is at windsor, ma'am.
Why is he not here?
He is sick, ma'am.
What is the matter with him?
We're having some problems with arcade ...
Maybe he's not dead.
Nick, alex, how are we today?
Now what seems to be the problem?
It's the game, arcade.

Four hundred, four fifty-
That's very generous of you.
We need to talk.
They arrived.
I'll talk to you later.
There will be generations because of what you did.
I did n't do enough.
Would it do any good?
A one-armed machinist, oskar?
Have you checked the ...
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
He's broken his pattern.
They've broken their pattern.
I would say we are now officially baffled.
I wo n't.
Do n't. think bailey.
Shit.

I heard a noise.
Outside.
Do n't do that. hang up ... call ...

Hello? ted?

I live here.
I thought you were going to the mixer?
I had to change. did anyone call?
Cotton.
Can we talk?
What do you want from me, cotton?
You could start with an apology.
Did it?
It helped me realize one thing.
What?
I get my revenge and make some fast cash.
It抯 over, cotton.
And much richer as a result.
Hi, gale, any leads?
Tons and tons.
Where is sidney's father?
Home -- where he lives.
And are the police sure about that?
What are you going to do?
Finish what my son started.
But you抣l never get away with it.
My documentary is due on tuesday.
What's your subject?
Not one bit.
Where's sid?
She dumped me.
No way.
Yeah.
It's okay. i can peddle toilet paper.

Where's sid?
Damned if i know. she ditched me.
She's got guards with her.
What guy?
He seemed harmless.

I really don抰 like that comparison, honey.
He hates oliver stone.
You抮e the one who got away.
So we found a compromise.
Hello, dwight.
I see you read the book.
So what made you change your mind about sidney?
I know that.
Not good. how you doin?
You broke my heart.
Can we turn the light on?
And it's sexier in the dark.

They're <unk>.
And joel's pre-med.
Ssshh! what was that?
This is all too familiar.
Jesus christ!
Let's go.
Dewey?
Three hundred people watched? nobody did anything?
They thought it was a publicity stunt.
Dewey, there's no such place.
Who is this?
Who are you?
That's not the way we play the game.
I do n't play games.
What do you want?
Where are you?
Oh -- a god complex

Asshole, ca n't talk.
Really? you're such a talented actor.
More of a game really.

To see your reaction.
Does the name maureen prescott sound familiar to you?
That's sidney prescott's mother.
Are you sure?
What do you know about trilogies?
You mean like, movie trilogies?
Must be exciting, beautiful place, beautiful people.
To me hollywood is about death.
Hmm.
Oh yeah, how?
Detective kincaid?

The killer called her.
I can see nothing's changed.

Where's gale?
Off the record.

And why is that? has something happened?
No, not yet.
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
Evening, ma'am.
Deputy ... good evening.
Ma'am, i am the deputy of this town.
People treat me like the <unk> of television journalism.
Shit. it's neil prescott's car.
I'll call for backup.
Does mom know?
Hey ... dewey. can we go now?
Did you reach my dad?
You're sure it was the hilton?
You girls ready.
Have they found my father?
Afraid not.
Should i be worried?
It's deputy riley today, sid.
We got him, sheriff. billy loomis.
Hank loomis' kid? aw ... jesus ...
I was first to respond.
What were you doing out here?
Drive by patrol.
How is she?
She staying with you?
Dewey! where the hell you been, boy?
That fish smelled strong.
Jesus ...
What is it? where's casey?
Where is she?
Casey! casey!
What's the delay?
How's the book?
I'll look for it.
I'm not here to fight.
Just stay back.
I want to talk to you.
Off the record. no cameras.
Please. you owe me.
I think you falsely identified him. yes.
Have you talked to cotton?
Many times.
Why would she lie about it?
Maybe that's because i'm not randy.
So where are you?
Why would you call me from my front porch?
So where are you?
Can you see me right now?
Uh-huh.
Hello?
<unk>!
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy ... again.
Are you okay?
Can you knock?
I heard screaming.

... so call if you need me.
Have a good trip.
Stu was with me last night.
Working, thank you.
I thought blockbuster fired you.
Stop. right there.
Do n't shoot. it's me.
Only if it's a nice meg ryan movie.
For about two seconds.
Jesus, this place is packed.
We had a run in the mass murder section.
So what's his reason?
Maybe sidney would n't have sex with him.
And what would be your motive?
I thought everything was checked out.
What's <unk> doing here?
He came to make up.
There goes my chance with sid.
Wan na another beer?
Yeah.
Come on, sid. give me the gun.
Why are they doing this?
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
Yeah, okay ... whatever.
Guess, i wo n't be needing this anymore.
Why are you doing this?
You're crazy -- both of you.
The official term is `` psychotic''.
Do you believe this shit?
Or a man's mentality.
Tell your mom i said thanks.
I'll be there by seven. i promise
Thanks, tatum.
Practice ran late. i'm on my way.
Whatever. just hurry.
Just another <unk> at the riley's.
Just like old times, ai n't it?
Do you really think billy did it?
Take a message.
Shit, what is he doing here?
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
I do n't know ...
I thought you dumped her for me.
With that set of lungs -- she should be.
Give it to me.
That's not necessary. you're in.
What do you think?
Have you heard?
No, i have n't heard.
Already.
It's none of my business anymore.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
Yeah.
What are you talking about?
I heard.
I have no understanding of this place anymore.
It's always been like this.
He's being <unk> tomorrow.
Where was the girl?
What? what?
Jesus christ, man, do n't shoot me!
Turn around. hands on your head!
Put it down. put it on the ground.
I do n't believe it.
What's so exciting?
What time is it?
Give me the gun.
You did n't know.
Where we headed?
Murderers?
A woman ...
Delusions of grandeur.
You should be thanking me.
Just keep leading the way.
You've made a good life for yourself ...
Here he comes.
You just met me.
Not here.
Drop it.
Who said this was murder?
There's a bucket here.
What?
It's a bucket of vomit.
You think it was poison?
It's too soon for him.
It's my wife.
How's that?
I'd like you to meet somerset.
What about sports?
You go to movies at least?
And, if it's a threat.
He's preaching.
Like in the parson's tale, and dante.
No fingerprints?
Nothing.
This is the one thing.
Nothing.
What the fuck is that?
There must be something.
What?
And you do n't?
Does this make it with you?
Does n't seem like our man, does it?
Why would we?
It is victor.
Sorry about that ... i just ...
We do n't know for sure ...
How much money do you have?
Well, that was money well spent.
How do you know all about this?
This is a waste of time.
It's not what you think it is.
The marquis de sade and origins of sadism.
Are you alright?
I'm fine.
Wait ... just wait.
It was him.
We need a warrant.
Think about it ...
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You stupid son of a ...
What are you talking about?
You do your job ...
Because he is john doe, by choice.
Slut.
Kiss me on the lips.
Stay with him.
Wait!
Throw your gun down now!
Throw your weapon, detective! now!
Tell me it's not true.
Put your gun down!!
Do n't do this ... please ...
Anything ... anything missing or different.
I do n't see anything.
Are you absolutely certain?
This painting ...
How long have you lived here?
It's a hard place.
You should look into private schools.
Did their son see it happen?
How's california?
How should i know?
Let's get along ...
What you saw was n't lucy.
Another one, eh?
Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
No sir ... pleasure.
You all right, sergeant?
He <unk> forth like a ...
What good does that do?
You got any more orders, captain?
What in ...?
Is captain clayton here, reverend?
Martin! ride me as far as the well!
Swear it, ethan? ... given word?
Scar! where's he holed in?
How'd you come by this?
You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
That's what i said.
Nothing for you to see.
You all right, ethan?
What you goin' to do?
Good night ... laurie ...
Why?
Oh ...
Futterman?
He just could n't wait ...
But i just bought a good blanket.
Ethan, quit it!
Nine ... ten!
No ... she's not ...
Stay out here.
They'll be back ...
What's that got to do with us?
Was your niece about their age?
I got your boy killed.
She's not a little girl any more.
You've seen her! ... she's alive?
Oh, all right! well ... martin says ...
Do n't go takin' that stuff ...
Finish your breakfast ...
Martie ... do n't go! not this time.
She'd be about thirteen now ...
We got two around that age ...
Why else?
Ellen, move aside ...
Stop that!
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
It still worked in town.
Hey ... the fuse.
Are you crazy? that costs a fortune!
Do you have a better idea?
I'll do it myself.
You?
Is everything alright? are n't you feeling well?
We just have to make a new beginning.
Cherry-red tears.
I miss tommi so much.
Who was that?
So, did you sleep good?
Where have you been?
Who's that?
Let me guess: another short circuit?
How did you get me out of there?
For god's sake, what happened to me?
Hello. can i help you?
Do i look like it that much?
Mrs. straub!
I've killed my husband!
You did n't tell her!
Peculiar? you mean, like back then?
Tenth floor.

Wonderful, wonderful.
Burbage says you have a play.
Good title.
Romeo <unk>. always in and out of love.
Yes, that's good. until he meets
Ethel.
Do you think?
The daughter of his enemy.
Good luck with yours, kit.
I thought your play was for burbage.
This is a different one.
`` good morrow, cousin.''
`` out.''
Two hours at prayer!
Not ready? where is she?
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
Be good to her, my lord!
When the queen commands it.
But at the playhouse. nurse?
Playhouses are not for well-born ladies.
Your majesty.
Your majesty.
What do you love so much?
And --?
And i love poetry above all.
When will you write me a sonnet, will?
Are you to be my muse, rosaline?
I am, master shakespeare.
`` ay me.''
You have opened the playhouses?
I have, master shakespeare.
My lady!
Who is there?
The same, alas.
Oh my lady, my love!
If they find you here they will kill you.
You can bring them with a word.
Can you love a fool?
I am.
I do not know how to undress a man.
There is.
Even your play.
Oh
And that was only my first try.
You would not leave me?
I must. look -- how pale the window.
Moonlight!
No, the morning rooster woke me.
Oh, let henslowe wait.
Mr. henslowe?
Let him be damned for his pages!
Oh -- no, no!
Oh, do not go
That's my line!
Then i will go with you.
You can not, wessex will kill you
Will! what --?
I love you, will, beyond poetry.
But all ends well.
How does it?
My lady viola.
My lord.
My lady viola.
But why me?
Will you defy your father and your queen?
It is not my riding day, my lord.
Bless me, i thought it was a horse.
Take off your hat.
My hat?
Where did you learn how to do that?
I...
Wait there.
Are you mr. shakespeare?
Yes, sir.
Do you understand me?
And break her heart and mine?
It is only ours you can know.
She loves me, thomas!
Here we come at last, my lord!
Is there a man?
You are on my ground.
What's his name?
All right, just a few questions.
Do a little <unk>, from time to time?
Serve.
I was trying to educate you.
Just serve.
In the same fashion as chess.
What?
Chess. chess is often used as well.
Will you shut up and play.
You're a bad loser.
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
What do you think?
About what?
About this guy, this hugo person.
I do n't have time.
He made it clear.
Have you seen him?
No.
Think about it.
No.
Come on, david.
No.
He's still here.
He could n't get his car started.
When are you going to let the police know?
You call them if you want.
So who's going to do it?
Dig the pit, i do n't know.
No, not that.
Then what? who's going to do what?
I ca n't do it.
I do n't hear this.
I just thought we should discuss it.
Finished.
But not quite.
Do n't you worry about that.
Is this necessary?
That was good.
Can we talk about something?
What's the problem?
I want to talk now.
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
Now.
How much did you pay?
I do n't know.
How much did you pay?
I do n't know.
How much?
What is this?
Security.
From what? jehovah's witnesses?
What? yes, that's fine.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
You're not eating.
You looking for me?
Who?
Your friends.
Cover it?
Well?
I do n't know.
Is this being recorded?
This is just an informal discussion.
Are you recording it?
What does it look like?
No. why should it?
Well, then?
I've never seen any of these men before.
Take another look at these two.
Well, is it?
What?
That's it, then.
That's all?
Sorry to waste your time.
Oh, no problems. do n't worry.
Just one thing.
That's right.
Well, cameron, are you comfortable?
Yes, thanks.
Good. well, you've seen the flat?
Yes.
And you like it?
What?
Cameron.
Cameron?
Yes.
Did you know --
She hated you --
Aroused and inflamed.
I'm not usually drunk.
It was you, juliet, it was you --
-- instead of what he is --
What i am.
-- which is --
-- which is a hack.
Know and love?
Yeah.
I think you're lying.
You're right.
Have you seen hugo?
David has n't seen him either.
So i gathered.
Maybe he did n't like us.
David?
Hugo.

We have to talk.
Later. but first -- him.

And the money?
We could put it somewhere.
Where he ca n't get it?
Now you thought of that, not me.
Expecting anyone?
No.
Are n't you going to answer it?
It's the only way.
I refuse.
You'll wait in the hall?
Alex.
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
It's about me and david.
The perfect couple, i should say.
Do n't you ever stop?
Interesting.
So, uh ...

Would you like to come in?
It's nice.
What's it about?
A priest who dies.

No.
It was some guy called brian.
Did he sound upset?
A little bit. is that good or bad?
Working nights?
I'm a doctor.
And he's a patient of yours?
No. but he needs treatment.
For what?
A certain weakness.
The human condition.
You know about it?
I write about it?
Yes.
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
Diseases.
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
I suppose so.
I mean, that's what it's like.
Offering it for debate.
You can tell by the <unk>.
Your watch.
Is it real?
Chicken salad.
Anyway, you remember harold?
I do n't know, i think ...
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
Do n't you like her?
No, it's a very groovy girl.
Do you think george is a fairy?
Who?
Yes, but ... i thought ...
What?
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
What do you expect me to do about it?
Lester.
We can not go into this later.
What're you looking for?
My keys.
Thanks a lot.

It turned out to be cancer.
I'll be back in a while.

You're late, george.

I do n't want to talk about it ...
But you do n't know what happened.

You're looking great, baby.
What're you doing later?
Why do n't you see lester?
Your husband?
Yes.
Is she all right?

Yeah.
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.

Good. i want to talk to you.
Ca n't you get to sleep?

Oh, it's a fire hydrant.
Sit down!
Maybe i will.
But wynant ---?
I do n't believe he did it.
So am i.
I'm going to take asta for a walk.

I want you to stay and find wynant.
I did find him!
What do you mean?
He was down in the shop.
Nick!
It was his body that was buried there.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
That's a fact.
Wynant's body?
Yup. do n't you want something to eat?
Huh?
Well, do n't they?
How long has he been dead?
Couple of months anyway.
Then he could n't have committed those other murders.
Smart gal.
Wynant dead? does dorothy know?
I'm going to tell her.
Yes!
Got a nice evening dress?
Who do you think did it?
Mimi ...
Mimi!

It's the only way it makes sense.
No, mr. charles.

Goodnight, spock.

To land any closer would risk detection.
Spock.

Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
Why ca n't you be nice to me?
Where are we going?
He did n't. he had it built.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
He phoned it in.
